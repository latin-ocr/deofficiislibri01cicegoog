Wise Man alone is capable of true friendship and gratitude3
all thar he doesis right, he alone knows how to rule, how to
obey, because heis free from all passions and therefore the
only true king. Even the arts, as Poetry, Divination, Ora·

the contrast between the Wise and the Unwise Man, and
represented their Wise Man according to an ideal standard,
although they were ready to confess that such axioms contra·
vened actual facts. When asked for historical examples of
· their ‘imaginary sage’ they could not reply. Even Zeno him·
self had not pretended toa personification of this ideal Virtue,
and of course the Stoics could not allow followers of other
systems to be what their own founder did not pretend to be
20 In accordante with their definition of the highest principle
and of the essential of virtue, the Stoics defined Duty (καθῆκον)
to be that which there is a sufficient reason for doing, ie. what is
appropriate and agreeable to nature. The first duty, therefore,as
was seen above, is to choose that which is agreeable to nature,
and we may consequently speak of animals doing their duty,
in so far as they act conformably to their nature ,· but the duty
of man is what reason prescribes Accordingly separate duties
are derived from the precepts of reason or from the several
virtues, as for example the duty of preserving outward ap·
pearances is prescribed by the virtue of moderatiori and dis·
cretion. The fulfilment of these, however, is not necessarily
aresult of perfect intention or of virtue, but may originate
with certain outward motives, not in themselves objectionable.
According to the Stoics perfection of intention alone is a Good.
‘l'hey canum, therefore, class mere iultilrnent of duty in itself
artrong good things, but only among the medium things, or, in
so far as the results offer some advantage, among those that
are desirable”. They described those actions which, though
