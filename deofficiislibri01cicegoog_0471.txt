1. 1. optumum auctorem] Any person who determines our belief, even
as awitness, is called anarrctor. Thus Tacitus Germ. 0. 18, 10 quoting Julius
Caesar as a witness with respect to the former state ol the Gauls3 calls him
stemnius auctorum, ie. ‘the hi hest of authorities,’ cp. beloW, §113 Poly-
bius, bonus auctor inprimis, or. Od. 1 18, 14 (Pythagoras) non sordidus
auctor naturas verique. As writers, particularly ol history, were the
authorities sor facts, ‘auctor‘ cameto mean ‘a writer.' Hence Juvenal
sat. vll 231 speaks oia preceptor of the Roman youth being required ut
legat historias, auctores ereverit omrres ίαυνρκαννι ungares digitosque sitos.

insimulant eum tragoediae] The tragic poete, especially Euripides,
like to represent Odyseeus as crasty and full ol intrigue and cowardly, and
so they frequently employ this myth, eg. Sophocles, in his play Ὀδυσσεὺς

μαινόμενος, Euripides frequently, and amongst the Romans Accius and Pacu·
