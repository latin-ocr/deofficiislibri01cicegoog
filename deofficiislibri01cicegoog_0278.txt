,Diogenes Babylonius and Panaetius, and was a friend of Polybius and
2 Terence, whose plays were by some ascribed to him. As tribune, he en·
deavoured (according to Plutarch Tib. Gracch. c. 8) to procura a redivision

· ⁴of the public land, but desisted from the attempt, and for his forbear-

the chief interlocutor in the dialogue. He is also one of the speakers in
