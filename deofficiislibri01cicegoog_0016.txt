enlarged and improved edition of that before published ,
by Unger. 1 have found great assistance from his corn-
mentary, which leaves few difficulties unnoticed. The
Introduction prefixed to this edition is substantially
a translation of his Einlez'rung. However much the
possession of these aids and appliances has diminished
·editorial work, the mere task of selection and com-
pression of materials, easy as it may appear to those
who have had no experience of it, is a constant strain
upon the judgment which requires no inconsiderable
expenditure os time and labour.

Wherever the actual words of the annotator have
been quoted, I have given his naine: where the derived
notes have undergone a change os form, ,Ι have not
made any special acknowledgment of the original
source from which they 'are taken. In the text I have

followed for the most part the recensipn of Orelli's

Cicero by Baiter and Halm, which must at present
be considered thegstandard edition. In some passages,
where ,a different reading has commended itsels to my
judgment, I have given that of Baiter in the adnotatio
critica, and in any variations os importance added the Ι
readings of the principal editors.
