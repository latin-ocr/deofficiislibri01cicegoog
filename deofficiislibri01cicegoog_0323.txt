Posidonius] Ποσειδώνιος was a distinguished Stoic philosopher, born about
ac, 135, apupil oi Panaetius. He was a native os Apamea in Syria, but
lived at Rhodes. Strabo calls him tiviro τῶν καθ’ ἡμᾶς φιλοσόφων πολυμα-
iterares: Cicero, who received instruction srom him when he visited ·
Rhodes, defin. 1, 1, styles him vel omnium Stoicorum maximum (1115 1o,
de nat. d. 1 5 7,5 113), and thought so highly of his powers that he.
requested him to write an account of his consulship, as a most notable
philosopher, to visit whom Pompey, on his return from the Asiatic war,
went to Rhodes. He was a man oi extensive and varied acquirements in
almost all departments of human knowledge, as a minute enquirer. He is
scarcely ever mentioned without some expression of affection, and Cicero
tells us that he read his works more than those of any other author. At
a later period he became a resident at Rome and stayed in Cicero's house.
The fragments os his numerous writings were collected by J. Bake and
published at Leyden 1810. See Introd. 5 3ο.
