‘⁸ Mr Sidgwick’s editing of the Sixth Book of Ovid’s Fasti sumishes a careful and set-vioeable
volume sor average students. It eschews ‘construes' which su rsede the use of the dictiooary.

illustrating peculiarities os style, true and t'alse derivations, and the more remarkable νιιὴῑίοωσζ
the tcxt.”-Saturday Revt'ew.

“Itis eminently good and usel'ul. . . . The Introduction is singularly clear on the astronom&
Ovid, which is properly shown to be ignorant and confused: there is an excellent little may ot
Rome, giving just the places mentioned in the text and no more ; the notes are evidently written
by a practical schoolmaster.’'- The A cademy.
