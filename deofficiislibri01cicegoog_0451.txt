any share in forging the will) sufficient to absolve them from being thought
to have done wrong? Νο; in my opinion it is not; though I always loved
one os thern (Hortensius, 11 ς 57), while he lived, and am no enemy to
the other, now that he is dead and gone) Cicero's liking sor his rival
Hortensius is attributed by Cornelius Nepos (vit. Ati„ 5) to their com-
mon friendship with Atticus ut intellegi non posset, nter euin plus diligeret,
Cc'cero ari Hortensius: et id, quod erat difficillimum, efficiebas, ut inter
quos tantae loudi's essct aemulatio, nulla intercederet obtrectatio essetque
talium uirorum copula. Hortensius after the coalition of Pompey with
Caesar and Crassus (ti-c. 60) withdrew from public life and confined him-
self to his dnties as an advocate; he died rac„ 50. Once only aiter his
retirement did he a pear in public, viz. ue. 55, to oppose the sumptuary .
law ο1 Pompey and rassus, the repeal ο1 which he obtained. For Crcero’s

quod ego ffcdi'sse me omne arbitrabar, residuum tamen insciente me suisset,
omne repente apparuit. The origin ο1 their enmity was that Cicero had
charged him with complicity in the Catalinarian conspiracy, Plut. Crass.
13, Sallust Cat. 48. Besides Crassus was ou terms of friendship with
Clodius, Cicero's bitterest enemy, and had prevented his condemnation
(ad Att. 1 16, 5), and therefore had neither opposed Cicero’s banish-
ment nor worked for his return. Still Crassus sought to be reconciled
with Cicero aster his return (Plut. Cic. 33), andan apparent reconcilia·
tion took place between them before Crassus’ departure for Asia: ad
