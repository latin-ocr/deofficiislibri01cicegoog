περὶ τοῦ καθήκοντος, because καθῆκον signifies what is ‘suitable‚’
‘becoming' Cicero replies to him⁸2 non dubitoquin καθῆκον offl-
cium sit nisiquidtu aliud, sed inscriptio plentur dc officiis: and in
another letter⁰ mihi non est dubium, pmii, quod Graeci καθῆκον,
nos officium· id autem quiddubitas quin etrum in remp. praeclare

Cicero resolved to dedicate the work to his son Marcns¹⁰.4

Marcus Cicero was born auc 689, nc. 65¹¹. His father
watched over his education with the greatest care, had him
taught by the best masters¹¹ and wrote for his especial instruc-

Marcus, then a youth of seventeen, joined the army of
Pompey, from whom he received the command of a squadron
of cavalry, probably only nominally, but to the satisfaction of
his general¹³. After the battle of Pharsalia (ac. 45), he was
desimus-of proceeding to Spain and taking part in the service
of Caesar against his former friends. He was, however, in-

Athens to prosecute his studies along -withseveral other young
Romans of distinguished family. Here, although provided
with a liberal allowance¹⁵, he fell into extravagant habits, but

Sicily and taking advantage of the amnesty in favour of exiles,
