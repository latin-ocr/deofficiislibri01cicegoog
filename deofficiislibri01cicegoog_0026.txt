Introduction , xxi

As Cicero does not present us with a connected view of the 12
principles of the Stoic philosophy in the deficiis, though he
frequently refers to them, a brief view of the salient points of
their system will not be out of place, so far as they bear upon
this treatise. The whole ethical philosophy of the Stoics, as
Cicero often says⁴⁹, concerns the question of the supreme good
What is that which possesses the highest value for us, which we
desire not for the sake of anything else but for its own sake ’
and by which we are influenced in all our actions as the highest
principle (advos οὗ ἕνεκα πάντα πράττεται, αὐτὸ δὲ πράττεται μὶν
ottob δὲ ἓνεκα“)1 In order to find this, the Stoics enquired
what was the primary impulse of all creatures (πρώτη ὁρμή,
prinapium naturale), and found it to be the instinct of self·
conservation⁴⁴. In other words, the natural appetite or ten·
dency of all creatures is to preserve their existingcondition
with its inherent capacities‚ and to keep clear of destruction
or disablement For, said they, it is manifest from the obser-
vation of animals and little children that their. instinct directs
them to love that which furthers· their nature and is agreeable
to it, and teaches them to avoid what is opposed to and de·
structive of it⁴⁸. All, therefore, which conduces to the advance
and improvement of the bodily and spiritual nature of man,
belongs to the original things which are agreeable to nature,
πρῶτα κατὰφύσιν, princepia naturalia, primo naturae (de finn.
111 ἓ 21). These are in part common to man with animals, in-
asmuch as man's nature is in part the same as that of animals.
Had the Stoics stopped with the principle that the acquisition
of what is necessary for sels-preservation was the highest good,
they would have arrived at that unlimited egoism which meets
us everywhere inanimal nature,'but they continued their deduc-
tions in the following manner. What is the highest good for 1³
each creature, what the highest object of his endeavour, must be
determined by the peculiar and distinguishing part of his being ;
