scobis philosophia laudata, prepecto eius tractatio optimo atque amplissimo
quoque dignissima est, de fin. 1 5 o philosophiae quidem vituperatoribus
satis responsum est ea libro, quo a nohis philosophia defensa et collaudata est,
cum esset accusata et vituperata ab Hortensio. Qui liber cum et tihi (Brute)
probatus videretur et iis, quos ego posse iudicare arbitrarer, plura suscepi.
The work alluded to is lost with the exception of a few fragments3 it was
named after the celebrated orator Q. Hortensius (1115 73), to whom it
was dedicated. It appears from ep. ad Att. xm 18 that the lhortensius
was written before the Academias were finished, ie. before July nc. 45.
Augustine confess. 1114 praises the work very highly, and says os it: illc
liber mutavit affectum meum et ad te e'ptsum, Domine, mutavit preces meas et
vota ac desiieria measecit alia.

euim, sicut occursum est. So Gr. ἀπαντᾶν. Having disposed oi the objec-
tion urged by the boni viri, Cicero now considers the objections of philoso-
phers and scholars (docti et eruditi), ‘How can you’, say they, ‘an Academic,
pretend to lay down fixed rules of duty, when it is a maxim of your sect
that nothing can be known? is not this a contradiction of your principles?
or will you admit that you don't know the truth of your own rules?'
Cicero’s answer is that heis not one of the Scepties or Aporetics‚ the
followers of Pyrrho, who held that all things were alike probable, and
nothing could have so much said sor it, but that as much might be said
against it, and accordingly doubted about everything. Nor was he one oi
the dogmafics, who held some things to be absolutely certain and some un·

certain, but, adopting a middle opinion, he maintains with the Academics ·

that some things are highly probable and some improbable ; though, there-
> sore, he does not positively affirm his rules as certain, yet as thinking thern
so extremely probable that no wisc man can resuse assent to them, he is
fully justified and quite consistent in laying them down. See Introd. 5 8.

1. 11. disserere] ‘to propound one's own opinion’ intermediate between
iudicare, affirmare, and disceptare ‘to weigh th‘e grounds for and
against, without expressing an opinion’ which was the method of the
Sceptics: de nat. deor.1115 95 ego vero ca, quoe disputavi, disserere
