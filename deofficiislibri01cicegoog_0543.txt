“Mr Reid has decidedly attained his aim, namely‚ ‘a thorough examination ol' the Latinity
of the dialogue.' ..... The revision of the text is most valuable, and comprehends sundry
acute corrections. ·‚; . This volume, like Mr Reid's other editions, is a solid gain to the scholar·
smalltrlrbfgldiiliiicsglairieldoei‘c'hlblmship is Mr Reid's able and thoroughledition of the De
Amana ol Cicero, a work of which, whether we regard the exhaustive introduction or the
instructive and rnost suggestive commentary, it would be difficult to speak too highly. . . . When
we corne to the commentary, we are only amazed by its fulness in proportion to its bulk.
Nothing is overlooked which can tend to enlarge the learuer’s general knowledge of Ciceronian
Latin or to elucidate the text.”— S aturday Revr'ew.

‘⁴ It is an admirable specimen of caresul editing. An Introduction tells us everything we could
wish to know about Archias, about Cicero's connexion with him, about the merits os the trial, and
the enuineness os the speech. The text is well and carefully printed. The notes are clear and
scholar-like. . . . No boy can master this little volume without feeling that he has advanced a long

“As a book sor students this edition can have few rivals. It is enriched by an excellent intro-
duction and a chronological table os the principal events ol* the life os Cicero ; while in its ap·
pendix, and in tbe notes on the text which are added, there is much ol the greatest value. 'lue
volume is neatly got up, and is in every way commendable.'’-Tl1eScotsman.

“Dr Holden's own edition is all that could be expected from his elegant and practised
scholarship. . .. Dr Holden has evidently made up liis mind as to the character os tbe
commentary most likely to be generally useful ; and he has carried out his views with admirable
thorougbness.''-Academy.

¹¹ Dr Holden has given us here an excellent edition. The commentary is even unusually l'ull
and eomplete; and alter going through it carelully, we lind little or nothing ro criticize. There
is au excellent Introduction, lucidly explaining the circumstances under which the speech was
delivered, a table ol' events in the lire of Cicero and a usesul index.'¹ Spectator, Oct 29, 1881.
