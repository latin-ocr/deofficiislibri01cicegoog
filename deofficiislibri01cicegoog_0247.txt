itti. exque] sciara

Mi. rebus rausum] ‘after a formai demand of satisfaction’ The
formal and public declaration of war was an indispensable preliminary to
ir among the Romans. This declaration was either conditional or pure.
The conditional was when it was made cum rerum repetitione, ‘a formal
demand for the restoration of the things in question,‘ on the expiration of
33 days. This was called clare'gatio (Liv. 1 32, 1v 30, v11 6, x 12, xxxw
3), A pure declaration (indictio) was without any condition, as when an
injury could not be redressed; or when war was first declared by the other
party. See Grotius de Iure Belli ac Pacis 111 c. 3, 5 7 (Vol. 111. p. 62,
ed. Whewell). Comp. Liv. xxxv} 3 where the fetiales before the war with
the Aetolians give out amicitiam renuntiatam raideri, cum legatis totiens
repetentibus res nec reddi nec satisfieri aequum censuissent.

denuntiatum et indicium] ‘given notice of and declared.'

i ³0. Popilius] M. Popilius Laenas, consultae. 172, was sent with
an army against the Ligurian mountaineers‚ whom he conquered after great
slaughter. See Liv. xn 7. Baiter, Hand and recent editors agree with
Lund in considering the whole of this passage as spurious. Popilius impe-
rator (without any praenomen) tenebat provinciam is vague and not like a
Latin expression. Again in 5 37 Marci quidem Catonis senis would scarcely
have been written, if reference had just before been made to the same per·
son. Patitur-obligat isgrammatically incorrect: priore ανιιιζςςο is a strange
phrase to express the ‘voidance of a former oath :’ as also is belluni manere
(Gr. arietaria πόλεμον) in the sense of bellum incipere. Moreover,
adeo for usque ea is not according to Ciceronian usage. See Hand Tursel-
iinus 1 p. 152, N'aigelsbach lat. Stil p. 556 ed. a.

iii. dimisit] ‘discharged'

P. 10, 5³7, 1. 3. est] ‘is extant,' 115 16. Plutarch quaest. Rom. c.
39, alludet to the same letter: διά τί τοῖς μη στρατευομένοις μὲν, ἐν στρατο-
πέδῳ δὲ ἄλλως ἀναστρεφομένοις, οὐκ ἐξῆν ἀνδρα βαλεῖν πολέμιον, οὐδὲ τρῶσαι;
καί τοῦτο Κάτων δ πρεσβύτης ἐν ἐπιστολῇ τινι δεδήλωκε, ’γράφων πρὸς τδν
viia καί κελεύων, εί παρεθείη τῆς στρατείας ἀποπληρώσας τάν χρόνον, ὑποστρέ-
φειν· ἢ προσμένοντα λαβεῖν παρὰ τοῦ στρατηγοῦ τὸ ἐξεῖναι τρῶσαι καί ἀνελεῖν
πολέμιον. Πότερον δτι τὴν ἀνάγκην μόνην ἐξουσίαν εῖναι δεῖ rot ἀνελεῖν
ἀνθρωπον· δ δ’ ἄνευ νόμον καί προστάγματος τοῦτο ποιῶν ἀνδροφόνος ἑστίη

L t. bello Persico] not ‘the Persian war‚’ as it has been translated,
but ‘the war with Perseus or Perses‚’ the last king of Macedonia, who
was defeated and taken captive by Paulus Aemilius nc. 168. After the
battle of Pydna, the northern part oi' Greece was made into a province,
under the name of Macedonia, as the southern part had been under the
name of Achaia aster the taking of Corinth by Mummius, 5 35 l. 15· The
clause eum in Macedonia-esset is rejected by Zumpt on the ground of the
improbability that the son of Cato should have been discharged by Popi-
lius and agam five years later by Aem. Paulus. He would therefore refer
the statemeuts of this section to the occasion before spoken of, ἓ 36.
