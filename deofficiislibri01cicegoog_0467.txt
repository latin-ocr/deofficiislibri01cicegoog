faeere ut rurrres habeat venditor quad hahuerit. The act of returniug an
object under these circumstances was called redhibitio, and a suit brought
to compel the seller to receive the object and to return the price was actio

redhi itaria and so iudicium redhibitorium. See Quintil. inst. or.

manifested a thievish disposition by stealing from his master, it was not
necessary to declare it when he was offered for sale. But ii the owner oi a
slave, when he offered him sor sale, concealed the lact that the slave had
made his master liable for damages by stealing from a third person, he was
