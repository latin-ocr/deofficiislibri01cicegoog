’ Lao. t.. 11101101 Lucius Calpurnius L. F. L. N. Piso Frugi,
the annalist (Brut. 5 106, de leg. 1 5 6, ep. ad lam. rx aa, a), was the
author of the law which established a permanent commission (quaestio
perpetu& sor the trial of provincial Governors who had been guilty of such
illegal acts as carne under the denomination repetundae. The law was
carried by him when tribunus plebis, Β. c. 149 (Brut. 1. c.). Pighius (ann.
Rom. 11 p. 447) gives the following as the supposed text of the law: uti

pecunias cepissent quoave eanemisissent, earum iniuriarum erga Romae quiri-
tari iuduioque quaesito sua repetere provinciales possent. The experiment
was found to work so well that from time to time new laws were passed,
by which new courts of a similar description were instituted sor the investi·
gation of different offences, as the leu Iunia passed by M. Junius Brutus,

atribune of the plebs, the lex Seruilia (nc, 105), the leu Acilia passed by ¹ '
