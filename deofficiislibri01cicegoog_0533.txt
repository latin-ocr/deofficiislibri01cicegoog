A SELECTION OF THE STATE TRIALS.

By J. W.W1LL18-BUND, M.A.,·LL.B., Barrister-at-LaW‚ Professor of
Constitutional Law and History, University College, London. Vol. l.
Trials for Treason (1327-1660). Crown 8vo. eloth, 18s.

“A great and good service hasbeen done treason, as it may be gathered from trials be-
to all students ot history, and especially to fore the ordinary courts. 'l'he author has
those of them who look to it in alegal aspect, very wisely distinguished these cases from
by Prof. J. W. Willis-Bund in the publica· those of impeachment for treason before Par·
liament, which he proposes to treat in afuture
volume under the general head ‘Proceedings
in Parliantent.”'— The Academy.

“This is a work of such obvious utility
that the only wonder is that no one should
have undertaken it before....ln many
respects therefore, although tlte trials are

tion of a Selectrbn of Casas from the S tare
Trt'aLr. . . . Professor Willis· Bund has been
istery oe'l'elul to give lucli selefffions fronththe

the Law of Treason which he wishes to
bring clearly under the notice of the student,

and the result is, that there is not a page in
the book which has not its own lesson .....
lnall respects‚ so far as we have been able
to test it, this book is admirably done.”-
Scotsman.

‘¹ Mr Willis-Bund has edited ‘A Selection
of cases from the State Trials’ which is
likely to form a very valuable addition to
the standard literature. . . There can
be no doubt, therefore, of the interest that
can be found in the State trials. But they
are large and unwieldy, and it is impossible
for the general reader to come across them.
Mr Willis-Bund has therefore done good
service in making a selection that is in the
first volume reduced to a commodious form.''
-Tte E xatniner.

“Every one engaged, either in teaching
or in historical inquiry, must have felt the
want of suchabook, taken from the unwieldy
volumes of the State Trials'’-Coutempora7y
Revisw.

“This work is a very useful contribution
to that important branch of the constitutional
history of England which is concerned with
the growth and development of tlte law ot'

more or less nbridged, this is for the ordinary
student's purpose not only a more bandy,
but a more useful work than Howell¹s.’'-
S aturday Revt'ew.

‘'Within the boards of this useful and
handy book the student will find everything
he can desire in the way of lists of cases
given at length or referred to, and the
statutes bearing on the text arranged chro-
nologically. The work of selecting from
Howell¹s bulky series of volumes has been
done with much judgment, merely curious
cases being excluded, and all included so
treated as to illustrate some important point
of constitutional law.'’-Glasgow Herald.

‘¹ Mr Bond's object is not the romance,
but tlte constitutional and legal bearings of
that great serres of causes celdbres which is
unfortunately not within easy reach of
readers ¹not happy enough to possess valua·
ble librarres. . . . Of the importance of this
subject, or of the want of a book of this
krnd, referring not vaguely but precisely to
the grounds of constitutional doctrines, both
of past and present times, no reader of his·
tory can feel any doubt.'’-Daily News.

THE FRAGMENTS OF THE PERPETUAL
EDICT OF SALVIUS JULIANUS,

collected, arranged, and annotated by BRvAN WALKER, Mn. LL.D.,
Law Lecturer of St John’s College, and late Fellow of Corpus Christi
College, Cambridge. Crown 8vo., Cloth, Price 6s.

“This is one of the latest, we believe
quite the latest, of the contributions made to
legal scholarship by that revived study of
the Roman Law at Cambridge which is now
so marked a feature in the industrial life
of the University. . . . In the present book
we have the fruits of the same kind of

mentaries and the Institutes. .. Hitherto

·the Edict has been almost inaccessible to

the ordinary English student, and such a
student will be interested as well as perhaps
surprised to find how abundantly the exta
fragments illustrate and clear oopoxnxswtr
have attracted hls attentron'xn the Zoton

thorough and well-ordered study which was taries, or tlte lnst'itutes, or dne XM*

brought to bear upon the notes to the Com·
