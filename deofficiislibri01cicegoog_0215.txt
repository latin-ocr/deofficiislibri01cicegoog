tto. Demefflue Phalereus] Demetrius ὀΦοληρεύς, socalled from
his birthplace, the Attio δῆμος, where he was born about uc. 345.
He was educated, together with the poet Menander, in the School ol
Theophrastus He began his public career about uc. 325, and soon
acquired a great name by his public speaking. As he acted thoroughly
in the spirit of Phocion he was made governor ol Athens by Cassander
uc, 317, an office which he filled sor ten years (Atheniensium remp.
exsanguem iam et iacentem sustnctaait Cic. de rep. 11 ς a). Afterwards,
becoming intoxicated with his extraordinary good fortune, he abandoned
himself to every kind of dissipation, which roused aparty of malcontents,
so that on the approach of Demetrius Poliorcetes to Athens he fied to
Thebes and thence to the court ol Ptolemy Lagi at Alexandria, where he
devoted himself to literary pursuits (Plutarch, de exil. p. 602 1²),and died
uc. 283. His numerous writings (a list os which is given by Diogenes
laertius v 8ο) embraced subjects of the most varied kinds ς he was the
last among the Attio orators worthy of the name (Cic. Brut. 8, Quintil. x
1 ἓ Bel: his speeches were characterised rather by grace arrd elegance than
by t'orce and sublimity. Cicero, Brut. 1x § 37, says ol him ε Phalereus suc·
cessit, eruditissimus ille quidem sed non tam armis institutus quam palaestra,
itaque delectabat magis Athenienses quam inflammabat: processerat enim
ia solem et puluerem non ute militari tabernaculo, sed ut e Theophrasti
doctissimi hominis eembraeulis. Hic paucus inflexit orationem et eam aeollem
teneramque reddedit et amois, aeut fuit, ardui munet quam gram's,· sed
mandate ea, qua perfienderet animos, nan qua perfringeret ; tantum ut
memoriam concinnitatis snae, non, quemadmodum de Pericle screpa't Eupolis,
cum delectatione aculnu acam relinqueret in animis carum a quibus esset
auditus: de legg. 111 ὅ 14a Theophrasto Phalereus ille Demetrius mi· =

11 395, orat. 5 94, Quintil. x 1 ἕ 33. He maintained however a happy
medium between the sublime grandem of Demosthenes and the flourishing
declamations ol his successors. By disputator subtilis is meant ‘a elever
essayist,' qui res eruditas egregie explicare potest.
