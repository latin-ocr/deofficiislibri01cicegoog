sage of the Brutus 5 155 bic eninr attulit banc artem omnium artium
maximam (scientific treatment), quasi lucem ad ea, qnae con nse ab aliis
aut respondebantur aut agebantur. In B.C. 51 he was elect consul with

5 ee, Lt. dicendi [marton] facultas] The word gravior looks
very like an interpolation, originally a v. l. of gratior. Zumpt, however,
retains it with this explanation: ‘gravior quidem quoniam minusad subti-
litates iuris privati descendit, sed vel contra has, sr opus sit, gravitate sna
pugnat)

especially named.
