not done with a perfect intention, are yet conformable- to law
and reason, as μέσα καθήκοντα, nudt'er ficta, and placed thern
in contradistinction to the actions of the wise man which are
the outcome of his perfect intention, and which they named
κατόρθωμα, perfectum optinum, omnibus numeris absolutum, ‘com-
plete rectitude of action'. Extemally, and judged by their
results, these two kinds of actions are perhaps alike, but
&entially they differ. The wise man works with all those
powers of a perfect soul, the union of which forms a beautiful
harmony3 the unwise man is impelled by external circum·
stances 3 the wise man follows solely the inward impulse of λ
his noble nature which never allows him to go wrong, while
the other acts under a law, the application of which is some-
times uncertain. The actions of the wise man are har- ’
moniously connected with each other, the other does what is
right by lits and starts and with intermptions. Since it is to
the intention alone that the Stoics attach any valae, while the
separate actions in which it is shewn are indifferent rothem,
the name κατόρθωμα may be given to every action of the wisc
man, should he do no more than raise a finger. For he does
nothing in which heis not guided by, and does not display, his
perfect intention.

The same contrast between intermediate and perfect duties 21
was employed by the ‘Stoics also in another way. The object
of duty is partly to realize virtue, partly to keep to such
things as are agreeable to nature and to avoid those which
are contrary to it. Accordingly they named the duties that
are directed to virtue καθήκοντα τέλεια or κατορθώματα, those
which are directed to external relations μέσα καθήκοντα, medio

ito, ut eius ratio reddi possit, ergo ut etlam probabiliter acti ratio reddi

possit. Est autern offici um, quod itafirctnm est, uteiusfoctiprobabilis ratio

reddi possit, ee quo intelligitur officium medriam quiddam esse, quad neque in

lonis ponatur neque in contraries. Quoniamque in iuretur, quaenequein

vertutibus neiat neque in vitiis, est tamen quoddam, quod'nsui possit esse,

tollendum id non est. Est auten eius generis a'ctio quoque quaedam, et

quidem talis, ut ratio postulet agere aliqm'd et facere eorum: quod autem

ratinu actum est, id ffciun dppellaenus: est igitur fficium eius gorens, ·
qnod nec in boun ponatur nec in contrariis.
