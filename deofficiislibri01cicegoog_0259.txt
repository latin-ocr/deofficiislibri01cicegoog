are not identical with those of circumstances,' i. e. though, as a general sule,
relations and the like claim our assistance in preference to any one else, .
there may be circumstances in which those not bound to us by such ties
have a better claim. For ita=hac ratione, hac via, cp. 11 5 101. 33,
5 141. 9, 1115 31 l. 13, Hand Turs. 111 p. 486.

1.1't. necessitudinum] This word expresses some ‘bond of union,’
‘tie’ formed by various circumstances, as by blood-relationship or affinity,
by belonging to the same collegium or society, by being colleagues in
office, by some services rendered, asin the case of intimate friends. Thus
Cicero speaks of the necessitudo existing between himself and the Sicilians,
formed by his having been Quaestor in Sicily (Div. in Caec.) and of the
necessitudo sortis between Verres and Caecilius, arising from the relation
they bore to each other as Praetor and Quaestor. Necessitudo does
not differ from but is originally identical in meaning with necessitas,
‘exigency,' ‘straits,' being only the older form of the word: thus Sallust,
who affects the use of archaic forms, uses it in its prinrary sense Cat.
xvll a in unum coenis convocat, quibus ntoxrnro necessitudo et pln-
rimnns audactae interant. See Kritz ad l. and comp. Tacitus Arm. 11164.
Still there is a difference in usage, thus defined by the ancient gram·
marians, via that necessitas means ‘the actual constraint imposed,’ steres-
situdo, ‘the condition ofa person in such a conamini) Walther has a
good note on this distinction in his edition of Tacitus Ann. 1 9.

temporum] ‘outward circumstances,' 5 39 temporibus adducti, 111

1. 11 consuetudo capientia] ‘we must acquire the habit! The ex-
pression is unusual, and its genuineness has been doubted, but it is vindi·
cated by Burmann on Ovid Art. Am. 11 346, and Ernesti whoin his (ionis
s. v. compares Cic Phil. 1115 ²9 patrium animiam virtutemque copiamu ·,
nat. deor. 11 5 140 deornm cognitionem capere, Phil. v 5 49 qui sensum
gloriae ceperit, pro Quinct. 5 97 capere oresericordiam i-e. misereri.

1. 21 boni ratiocinatores] ‘accurate calculators,' i.e. in striking a
balance of claims and obligations, so as to know how much is due to
each. The Stoics considered this sikoycorta as a special virtue: Stobaeus

risit τῶν γιγνομένων seul ἀποτελουμένων.

1. 24. addendo deducendoque cei] ‘by adding and subtracting

pertinet! aaran

5 00, 1. 19. traduntur itta quidem] ‘are delivered, it is true, but.’
The pronoun ille is frequently inserted be'fore the particle qso'dem with
a concessive signification, as 5 a, 5 16, 5 66, magnios illas quodenset,

595 totum illud quidem, 5 103 uti illo quidem, 111 5 71, 118; more
rarely the other personal pronouns, e. g. is, Tusc. disp. 1v 5 5 sapientiae
studium vetros id quidem in nostris sed tomen cet. ; 560 est ea quidem
utilior sed raro proficit ; tu, de off. 1 5 1 disces tu quidem sed. See Kiihner
