1. 36. alae alteri] is the reading be correct this must mean ‘one of the
two alae or divisions of the allies.’ ‘The infantry ol the socii was placed
on the wings os the legions, and hence the words ala, alarii and cotona
alariae are employed to designate the whole sorce oi the altres, both horse
and foot‚ and the two divisions were distinguished as dextera ala and
sinistra ala. Αἰαίη this sense must be carefully distinguished from alo
when it signifies the 300 Roman horse which formed the cavalry of the
legion and which received their name in like manner from having been in
ancient times employed to cover the flanks.' Ramsay Rom. Antiq.
p. 385. Heine has the following note: ‘the cavalry of the allies garili-
ares) was divided into alae, containing from 300 to 400 men. In icero’s
day it was usual for young men of the higher class not to enter the legion
directly‚ but to serve first as contubernales imperatoris, and they received
generally the command of an ala. The custom was continued in the time
os the Emperors (Plin. Ep. x 19‚Sueton. Aug. 38, 46, Claud. 13), and
young Cicero received the distinction in his syth year. Consequently,
alteri must be expunged, for there were not two alae to a legion, but more
or less according to circumstances. Ala altera could only refer to the hali
os the army of socii, the Italian allies, who were divided into ala dextaa
and sinistra, but the difference between socii and legiones Romanae had
ceased, since the Italians had been enfranchised‚ 110. 89. Atera· was added
by some one unacquainted with the division of the army, and to whom
therefore ala without altera appeared unintelligible!
