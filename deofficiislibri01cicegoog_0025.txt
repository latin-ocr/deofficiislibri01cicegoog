suited his purpose ⁸⁴. In the philosophy os the Stoies he found

the doctrine of duties carried into detail: their system more
than any other represented man as independent of externa}
circumstances, and it appeared to him nobler and greater to
say with the Stoies that the morally good is alone and at all
times expedient, than to maintain with others that there are

virtuous actions which are not expedient, and expedient which
are immoral⁸⁵. Notwithstanding he cannot accept all their
conclusions. Much is uncouth and offends against good man·
ners and natural feeling, by which he is guided more than
by philosophie conviction. The relined Roman has a great
horror of all cynical rudeness‚ from which the Stoics are not
wholly exempt³⁸. The notion also that the wise man may be
happy under pain and ought to be wholly independent of ex·
ternal circumstances, while it seems to him sublime, is too
much opposed to his own instinctive feeling not to admit ol
some concession to the Peripateties⁸⁷. Above all he regards
as absurd the Stoie paradox, that all unwise men-and such
all men are, properly speaking, according to the Stoico-are
unwise, all bad men bad, in an equal degree, all foolish men
equally foolish³⁸, that, short of the standard os perlection, all
saults and vices are of equal magnitude: the first of these
dogmas he ignores in the de rffia'ti, and of wrongs he says that
those done from thoughtlessness are less criminal than such as
are wilsul and premeditatedt. He commends highly the pre·
sereneo which they assign to a life ol practical activity over one
ol philosophieal contemplationt’. The Stoies say that a wise
man should at least take some part in the state, where an
inclination to progress manifesta itsell : so Cicero calls it
cowardice ond neglect ol duty to their country, if those who
have the alrility do not devote themselves zealously to the
public service⁴¹.
