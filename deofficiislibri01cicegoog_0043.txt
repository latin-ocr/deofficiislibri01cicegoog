xxxviii Introduattbn

which are proved by examples rather than by general consi·
derationS, we may trace more or less the results of Cicero's
own personal experience‚ and this constitutes the chief charm
of this work and its superiority over some of his other writings.
But the proofs which he makes use of are merely superficial;
we look in vain for any profound discussion on philosophical
principles, sor any psychological system, and, where abstract
questions are inevitable‚ they are treated without any tech-
nical knowledge or subtilty of reasoning.

377 This is undoubtedly a defect in the Work. It may be
explained partly by the fact that Cicero was¹ without pro·
found philosophical training‚ partly by the fact os his mind

being more directed towards questions of practical interest,
partly because he composed the work carelessly and under un·

favourable circumstances. On the other hand he does not
¹adopt the scholastic distinctions and definitions os the Stoics,
which are equally useless for philosophy and practice. He
exhibits always sound sense and wide experience, such as is
possessed only by one who from his earliest years has been
conversant with public life and taken an active part in forensic
business, who once stood himself at the head of the state and
was the leader of a great political party. Moreover his true
moral instinct keeps him as far aloof from the ambiguities ι
of Diogenes’ morality‚ as from the rudeness which even Chry-
sippus had caught from Cynicism. His noble patriotism, his
Roman pride coupled with his love for Greek learning, are
always apparent, and, if he is deficient in systematic philo-
sophy, the want is in some degree at least compensated by
his everlasting moral axiom that what is virtuous is always

taxed with faulty arrangement and frequent repetitions In
the second Book concerning the question how we can make
others useful to ourselves Cicero gives the same subdivision
twice over§2r and522, but issisl he abandons it and makes
the whole subordinate to the question how we are to acquire

fame. He recurs oftener than necessary to certain very fami.
