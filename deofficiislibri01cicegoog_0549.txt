i SKETCH OF ANCIENT PHILOSOPHY FROM

THALES TO CICERO, by Josnvir B. Mnroit, M.A., Professor 01

Μο101 Philosophy at Kin ’s Colle e, London. Price 35. od.

“It may safely be affirmed that 1 Mayor 1οε successfully accomplished all that he here sets
u. His arrangement is admirably methodical, his style is simple but nervous, his knowledge
'his subiect full and accurate, and his analytical expositions lucid and vivid....It is therefore a
annal which will prove 01 great utility to University undergraduates, 101 whom it was par·
urlarly pre red, and also for all who study Plato, Aristode, or other philosophers, 10 the
iginii. indicated readers, generally, will nd it ari admirable introduction, or epitome, 01
retent speculative thought, and ‘a key to our present ways 01 thinking and judging in regard to
atreis 01 the highest importance! ’'-The Britr'slt Mail.

‘⁸ 10 writing this scholarly and attractive sketch, Professor Ma or has had chiefly iii view
indergraduates at the University or others who are commencing 1110 study of the philosophical
aits of Cicero or Plato oi· Aristotle 10 the original language,' but also hopes that it ‘may be
und interesting and useful by educated readers generally, not merely as aii introduction to the
10101 history of philosophy, but as supplying alrey to our present ways of thinking and judging

hich he has endeavoured to give a eneral view of the philoso hical systems illustrated by the
inlus of the masters of metaphysieai and Ι01111001 science froin itales to Cicero. In the course
his sketch he takes occasion to give concise analyses of Plato's Republic, and of the Ethics and
>litics 01 Aristode: and these abstracts will be to some readers not the least useful portions of
e book. It may be objected against his design in eneral that ancient philosoph is too vast
id too deep a subject to be dismissed iii a ‘sketch-that it should be left to those wic will make
a serious study. But that ob'eetioii takes no account 01 the large class 01 persons who desire
know, in relation to present discussions and speculations, what famous men iii the whole world
ought and wrote oii these topics. They have not the scholarship which would be necessary 101
iginal examinationes authorities: but they have aii intelligent interest iri the relations between
icienstt andmoylzcrnghilojophy, and need just such information as Professor Mayor's sketch will
