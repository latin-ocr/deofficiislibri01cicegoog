1. 22 legem agrariam] an agrarian law was an enactment lor dividing
among the Plebs a certain portion of the ager publicus or State Domain,
consisting os land taken by conquest from the enemy at various times
Thus the lex licinia, one of the earliest agrarian laws, proposed that no
one should occupy as tenant os the state (posn'o’emt) more than 500 jugera
os the public land, and that the remainder should be allotted as property
to the poorer classes. These agrarian laws related only to the public land,
occupied and rented by the patricians, as possessores, and had nothing to do
with private property. This rs a subject of great importance‚ and one
which has been much misunderstood. SeeDict. Antiqq„ Art. ager prob
