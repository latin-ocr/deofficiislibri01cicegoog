is agreeable to Reason? This question can only be answered
in detail, if we consider the various promptings of reason, of
which we shall speak later, but, in general, the answer to it ,
presents itself that man’s reason is but a part of and efflux
from the universal reason, which pervades, shapes and rules
the whole world. Whatsoever, therefore, divine reason pre
scribes as law, harmonizes also with man's reason, and so ‘the
life according to reason (ὁμολογουμένως ξῆν) is to be sought
no less in· the harmony with its own than with the laws of
universal reason
That state of the soul which qualifies us for such aperfect life 15

is Virtue, or perfected disposition, which is accordingly defined
as διάθεσις ὁμολογουμένη or διάθεσις τῆς ψυχῆς σύμφωνος ἑαυτῇ
περὶ ὅλον τὸν βίονω. As then Virtueis not desired from fear ·
or hope of something else, but for its own sake, because it is the
highest good (αὐτοτελές), so is it also perfect happiness, which
according to the nature of the soul consists only in its having
perfect harmony with itself and with the godlilre. On the
other hand it follows from this that what is immoral is the
supreme absolute evil. This axiom of the Stoics puts them in
direct opposition to the Epicureans, who acknowledge that
virtue isa great good, but only for the advantages which
it confers; while the practical application of it leads them
into conflictuwith all other schools of philosophy. All'other 16
desirable things, such as wealth, dignity, power, health,
in one word all external advantages, which are not in our
own power, are desired not for their own sake but for the
happiness which they procure. They are not expedient in
all cases, but may be sometimes harmful, they may be em-

, ployed not only for good but also for evil⁸¹. The Stoies
