Introduction xxv

the only evil is that which is morally bad. This identity of
the morally good and the expedient the Stoics expressed by
the axiorn μόνον ἀγαθὰν τὰ καλόν, ninii honestum nin quod utile,
nihil utile nisi quod honestum.

The good man will take these outward possessione only for 17
what they are worth, he will despise all happiness or un-
happiness that prociseds from them (omnio hnmano contemnet),
and will not allow the impassive calm of his soul (ἀταραξία),
wherein consists what is rational, to be disturbed by them. He
is therefore free from all passion, from sorrow, from excessive
joy, and no less from fear and repentance. He who possesses
this true virtue is pronounced by the Stoics to be the ‘Wise
Man’ He is the perfect, the absolutely virtuous, happy and
independent man.

According to this definition of virtue, since the most perfect 18
state of mind is produced by an uninterrupted harmony with
reason, it is as impossible to imagine a gradation of virtues,
as to possess one virtue isolated from the others. The virtue
of the Stoics is therefore no quality of the mind (ἕξις), which Ι
each man may possess in a greater or less degree and improve
by practice, but a definite and unchangeable condition (διάθε-
σις τῆς ψυχῆς), which is as different from the condition of the
non-virtuous soul as a straight line is from a crooked one⁵⁹.
All wise men are equally virtuous, equally happy, and there is
nothing midway between good and evil. This perfect state of
mind one can only have or not have, all unwise men therefore
are equally wicked and unhappy, slaves of their passions and .
of outward circumstances3 nothing is expedient to them, they
can do nothing right 3 and, as the Stoics further 'teach that
Mind alone has any worth, the mode and manner in which
it exercises itself is indifferent 3 they considered all faults on a
