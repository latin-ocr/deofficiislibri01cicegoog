1. 9. hostis vocaretur] Hune, in a note to his Essay on Commerce,
differs in opinion from Cicero. ‘The more antient Romans' says he ‘lived
in perpetual war with all their neighbours, and, in old Latin, the term
hostis expressed both ‘a stranger’ and ‘an enemy! This is remarked by
Cicero, but by him ascribed to the humanity oi his ancestors‚ who soit-
ened as much as possible the denomination of an ene m by calling him by
the same appellation which signified a stran ger. It is however much more
probable, from the manners of the times, that the ferocity of those people
was so great as to make theru regardpll strangers as enemies‚ and call
'them by the same name. It is not, bes1des‚ consistent with the most com·
mon maxims oi policy or nature, that any state should regard its public
enemies with a friendly eye, or preserve any such sentiments lor them, as
the Roman orator would ascribe to his ancestors Not to mention that the
early Romans really exercised piracy‚ as we learn from their first treaties
with Carthage preserved hy Polybius: and consequently, like the Sallee
and Algerine tovers, were actually at war with most nations, and a stranger
andan enemy were with them almost synonymousss Donaldsou (Varroni-
anus ed. 3, ch. v1 5 8 p. 244) notices that ‘the Latin bostis and the Greek
ξένος, starting from opposite points, have interchanged their significatione
Hostis from unns originally signified a person entertained by another, ‘one
who has food given to him,' (comp. hospi-[ihi ‘the protector oi strangerS,’
Germ. ‘gast,’ but at last it came to mean ‘a stranger' ⁴ a foreigner ;’ and even
‘an enemy.’ Whereas ξένος originally denoting a ‘stranger’ (extraneus)
ip. onde without (ἐ-ξένος), came in the end to signiiy ‘an entertainer' aud
‘rien ’.

a foreigner a title to property when claimed by a citizen. Right of owner·
