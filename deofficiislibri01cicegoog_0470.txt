1. 10. commutata utilitate] ‘by a change of expediency,’ ie. when the
purposes they were intended to serve are reversed, 5 72.

110. ae-quuem] 5 65 l. 9, Hand Turs. 1 p. 50²·

ἡ de tls quae—utilitates] ‘of those objects which appear to be expe·
d1ent under a mask of wrsdom, but really are opposed to justice! On the
plural utilitates see 1 5 78 note.

1. 19. sed quonlam admissorem] On the deficiency of this classi·
fication and the carelessness shewn in subjoining it here for the first time
see Introd. 5 39, cp.15117. We may remark further, that this supple·
mentary division inserted here, which occurred to Cicero probably only
while writing, obliges him to repeat what he said above ac de iis rilem,
quae videntur-arbitror dictum in the words ac de prudentia qu‘ em cet.
The words 571 quocirca astutiae tollmdac sunt caque malitia, quae nult
illa quidem videri se csse praudentium are generally regarded as the end ot
the first section on false prudence. Yet Cicero would have expressed him·
self more distinctly if he had meant to distinguish the examples from one
another in this manner 3 at any rate in all cases, where apparent expedi·
ency is preferred to virtue, injustice as well as a misconception of true
expediency and therefore false prudence shews itself; accordingly they are
not easily distinguished from each other. The following examples likewn'se
shew a conflict of expediency with justice more than with high mindedness.
Still all this does not amount to a reason for pronouncing the words aede
praecientia—temperantiae to be an interpolation, as many do. For the
words scd quosnam-virtutis inimica could only form the transition to the
next division, which is to treat of the conflict between high-mindedness and
expediency, on the supposition that virttes=magnitudo aninei. As itis,
Cicero never uses virtus in contradistinction to iustitia. Even ifuirtru
had this sense here, the point would have been missed: because we derive
duties from four kinds of virtue, we shall have to deal with the same four
kinds of virtue, when we treat of the condiet between expediency and
high-mindedness. Finally, if the first division treated of the conflict be
tween apparent prudence and justice, and the second part began only here,
Cicero could not say as he does c. 33 restat quarta pars. Heine.
