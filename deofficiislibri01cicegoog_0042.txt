ol public activity. The part concerning justice is taken up
with the questions what are just reasons sor commencinga
war, how conquered enemies are to be treated: and thesc
questions are not discussed from a philosopher’s point os view
but from that of a Roman statesman The following part on
magnanimity (magnitudo animi) is treated entirely with reler-
ence to Romans who occupy a high position in the state. We
find the writer constantly giving way to the complaint that
men endeavouring to attain prominent power and authority
so easily become dangerous to the community⁹⁸3 those who
are prevented from seeking public offices from sear of trouble
and the uncertainty of success are censured⁹⁴2 and, in addition
to several precepts lor those who are govemors of the state, the
question whether the office of a general or that of a statesman
be the more useful and honourable is discussed with special
fulness. His remarks about the different kinds of speech (ι c.
37, cp. 11 c. 14) are merely a repetition os the thoughts which
are propounded in his oratorical writings. Lastly, none but a
Roman could talk as Cicero does in 1 c. 4² concerning the
several vocations becoming a gentleman.

The independent judgment of Cicero is still more visible 36
in his second Book We have only to look at such pas-
sages as chapters 13 and 14 containing advice to a young
Roman, who is desirous os winning glory and authority with
the people, or c 15—24 on the acquisition of popularity by
means of public distributions‚ on the administration of public
offices, and on popular laws and institutions‚ to be convinced
that we are not reading a mere translation from a Greek philo
sopher. But the treatise is deficient as a philosophical system:
it osten loses by confusion⁹⁵. This portion os the work and the
entire arrangement of his subject is entirely borrowed from
Panaetius—who however is not chargeable with Cicero's want
ol cleamess in exposition ; in the other true and striking but
loose and scattered remarks and precepts, which are derived
less from Stoic principles than from Roman views of lile and
