before Panaetius. After Chrysippus, who was the first to de·
velope this part os the Stoic philosophy⁷⁴, the paraenetic part
of ethics, τροτροπαὶ and ἀποτροταί, was treated as a special
branch. It is not unlikely that the earlier schools also
adopted the tripartite division os duties followed by Panae-
tiuS, viz. those which are prescribed by virtue or expediency,
as wellas his opinion concerning the collision os both kinds.
We are told particularly that he was the first to divide virtues
into theoretical and practical⁷⁶3 that is to say, he combined
the Platonic-Stoic division into iour virtues with the Aristo
telian distinction between the intellectual (διανοητικαὶ) and
practical (η’θικαὶ), distinguishing prudence asa theoretical, the
other three as practical virtues⁷⁶. As to the objection which 29
Cicero makes⁷⁷ that he did not begin his work with a definition
of ‘Duty‚' this may be accounted for by the popular form in
which it was composed. Besides the word had already a fixed
definition in the Stoic school. Panaetius requires rather to be
justified against the other reproaeh os Cicer0⁷⁸, that he has not

honestans, duobus propositis utilibus utrum atilius. For a con·
flict between particular virtues contradicts the very idea of
virtue, and the more so because according to the theory of the
Stoics all virtues centre in Knowledge. Such questions how·
ever as, whether it is better to be honoured or to be rich, to be
a landlord or a manufactum, where Cicero⁷⁰ supplements what ,
Panaetius has omitted upon expediency, have surely no con-
