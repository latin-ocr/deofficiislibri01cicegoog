Llo. Demetrius Pholmoua] Demetrius ὄΦαληρεύς, so called from
his birthplace, the Attic δῆμος, where he was born about lac. 345.
He was educated, together with the poet Menander, in the School ot'
Theophrastus. He began his public career about nc. 325, and soon
acquired a great name by his public speaking. As he acted thoroughly
in the spirit of Phocion he was made governor of Athens by Cassander
13. c. 317, an office which he filled sor ten years (Atheniensium remp.
exsanguem iam et iacentem sustentavit Cic. de re . 11 9 a). Afterwards,
becoming intoxicated with his extraordinary g fortune, he abandoned
himself to every kind of dissipation, which roused a party of malcontents‚
so that on the approach of Demetrius Poliorcetes to Athens he fled to
Thebes and thence to the court of Ptolemy Lagi at Alexandria, where he
devoted himself to literary pursuits (Plutarch, de exil. p. 602 r), and died
lac. 283. His numerous writings (a list of which is given by Diogenes
Laertim v 80) embraced subjects of the most varied kinds3 he was the
last among the Attic orators worthy os the name (Cic. Brut. 8, Quintil. x

by force and sublimity. Cicero, Brut. 1x ἕ 37, says of him r Phalereus suc·
