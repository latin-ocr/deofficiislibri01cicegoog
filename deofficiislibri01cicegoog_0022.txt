the relation of God to the world is of importance for our hap

Cicero had himself bestowed most thought on Ethics and
sought to form his own conclusions, although he had not
enough originality of genius to introduce any new theory, and
was deficient in the philosophical training necessary for the
productiori of a complete system. The negative character of y
his convictions is seen especially in his rejection of the Epi-
curean doctrine of Pleasure, while he wavers as if unable to
make up his mind between the Stoics and Peripatetics where
these two schools are not in accordance. Setting aside those of 6
his minor writings which refer to ethics, as the de amicitia and
de serectute, we can easily recognize the connexion which sub ’
sists between the rest. Thus in the five books de finibus he
compares and discusses the opinions of the three Greek schools,
the Epicurean, the Stoic and the Peripatetic, on the question
what is the supreme good-the fundamental principle of prac-
tical wisdom-and thus lays the foundation for future super-
stmcture. In the Tusculanae disputationes he examines various
leading points of ethical philosophy, viz. such as belong to
Psychology, in the discussion of which he handles the dogmas
of the Stoic, Academic and other schools as an eclectio rather
than in a sceptical and polemical spirit. The three books dc
‹fflu'is are taken up with the paraenetic part of ethics, the
precepts of practical philosophy,'and are thus connected with
the work definibus. As to the commentorius‘de virtutibus, men-
tioned by Charisius 11 p. 200 ed. Keiv', it is not known in
, what relation it stood to the above books. It was, anyhow,
a supplementary treatise, but it seems to have been a collection
of dogmas rather than a work elaborated for publication.
Cicero acknowledges himself a follower of the Academy as 7 ’

revived by Karneades‚ in regard to the dogma that man can·
not know anything for certain, but it would be wrong to con-
sider him for this reason a Sceptic in the proper sense of the
y word The object of his Scepticism was not to prove the im
