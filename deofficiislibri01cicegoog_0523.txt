SAYINGS OF THE JEWISH FATHERS,

comprising Pirqe Aboth and Pereq R. Meir in Hebrew and English,
with Critical and Illustrative Notes By CHARLES TAYLOR, D.D.
Master of St John's College, Cambridge, and Honorary Fellow ol
King's College, London. Demy8vo. cloth. ros.

“ It is peculiarly incumbent on those who
look toJerome or Origen for their theology or
exegesis to learn something of their jewish
predecessors. The New Testament abounds
with sayings which remarkablycoincide with,
or closely resemble, those of the Jewish
Fathers; and these latter probably would
furnish more satisfactory and frequent illus·
trations of its text than the Old 'I'estament’'
-S aturday Review.

“The 'Masseketh Aboth' stands at the
head of Hebrew non-canonical writings. It
is ot ancient date, claiming to contain the
dicta of teachers who flourished frorn a. c. 200
to the same year of our era The precise
time of its compilation ln its present form is,
of course, in doubt. Mr Taylor’s explana·
tory and illustrative commentary is very full
and satisfactory.”-Spectator.

“If we mistake not, this is the first pre·
eise translation into the English language

titlltltlllttllll tttt’tlnllt’lt
the first instance of that most valuabIe 3ηά
neglected portion of Jewish literature being
treated in the same way as a Greek classic
in au ordinary critical edition. . . The Tal-
mudic boolts, which bave been so strangely
neglected, we foresee will be the most im·
portant aids of the future for the proper un·
derstanding of the Bible. . . The Sayzngs of
tlte Jewist Fatlrers may claim to be scholar·
ly, and, moreover, of a scholarship unusually
thorongh and finished.''—Dublin Univer·
sity Magazine.

“A careful and thorough edition which
does credit to English scholarship, of a short
treatise from the Mishna, containing a series
of sentences or maxims ascribed mostly to
Jewish teachers immediately preceding, or
rmmedIately following the Christian era. . .''
-Contemporary Review.
