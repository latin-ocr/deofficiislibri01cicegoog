xlii Introduction

reading (ε. g. 15 28 in altero detorquent, 11 ’ᾗ 76 abstinentiae for
sapientias, §89 quid tertium? male pascere for male vestire),

that the writer must undoubtedly have had access to a source*
in many respects superior to that from which the codices of
the other family spring. On the other hand the codex, from
which Bem. c. emanates, has been subjected to the most ca·
pricious alterations of reading. Entire changes in the order os
words, corrections such as 1 ἓ 77 concedat laureo pari for el.
laudi, 1 §88 lenitudo animi for altitudo antini, numerous mis·
placed attempts at emendation, leave no room for doubt that
the copyist, whoever he was, has purposely tampered with
the text, whereas the corruptions of the other codices arise
rather from the ignorance or carelessness of the transcribersr·
we must therefore employ these in the first instance for aseer·
taining and settling the text, while great cantion is necessary in
using Bernensis c, although we cannot entirely do without it.

The editio princeps was printed at Mayence in 1465 by Fust
and Schbffer, the second at Mayence in 1466 by Fust and de
Gemshem, the third at Rome by Sweynheym and Pannartz in
1469, the fourth at Venice by ,de Spira in 1470 ; the first of these
is extremely rare. More than thirty editions were published be·
fore the close of the fifteenth century. Of subsequent editions
those of Aldus (1517) and (1541), the Augsburgh (1535), the
Venice (1538) ed. by Paulus Magnolus, and (1581), the -Ant-
werp (1563), the Bale (1568), the Amsterdam (1688) by J. G.
Graevius with variorum notes (1710), reprinted by Garatoni,
Naples 1777, the Oxford (1695) by T. Cockman, ' that of
Facciolati (Padua 1720, reprinted at Venice 1747), deserve
attention' =

There are several English Translations‚ by R. Whytinton
(London 1534, 1540), by Nicholas Grimalde (London 1553,
frequently reprinted), by Roger l’Estrange (London 1680), by
T. Cockman (London 1706, frequently reprinted), by Guthrie
(1755). The best German translation is by Dr R. Kiihner,
Stuttgart, 1859. ’
