an oath, in which it is otherwise (ie. in which you did not think at the
time you swore it that it ought to be performed). it is not perjury to break
it.’ Grotius misunderstood this passage irorn supposing that Cicero was
speaking oi the intention oi the person who administers the oath, de iure
b. ac p. 11 xiii a (Vol. 11 p. 86 ed. Whewell).

l. 28. ut mens conciperet] i. q. homo mente conciperet.

Stoice: Stobaeus ecl. eth. 11 p. 130 τὸ μέντοι ψεύδει τοτὲ συγχρὴσιισθσς
νομίζουσι τὸν σόφου κατὰ πολλοὺς τρόπους ἄνευ συγκαταθέσεως (ie. uti

this position oi Cicero, aiter approving of the conduct of Pomponius,
Regulus and other instances adduced by Cicer03 he says that oaths may
be exchanged inter quouis: the reason is that ‘we are not to have respect
to the person to whom the oath is made, but to God by whom we swear3
aud this is sufficient to produce an obligation’ He then proceeds to
say that ‘though the law os Nations recognises a distinction between an
enemy and a robber, yet this difference cannot hold, when, though the
right oi the person sail, our business is with the Deity.' See also
Whewell's Elements ofMorality 111 ch. 15.

Ρ. 184, 5100, 1. 1. non enim] 1562. Translate: ‘ior it is not
the simply swearing what is salse that constitutes perjury, but perjury

conscience iix animi tui sententia), as our law-forms express it, to perform.¹
Cp. 1 ὅ 40 semper autem in fide quid senseris, non quid dixeris

sententia means also ‘according to your liking!

‘where’ says Paley, ‘the meaning is, that the words oi the oath were
uttered without a iull knowledge os the facts oi the case, and therefore
the oath is not binding’ In casuistry this holds good. Aristophanes, who
in Ranae 1417 and elsewhere ridicules this verse, gives it a wrong meaning
by making the remark a general one. It is clear that the verse was oiieu

uoted, even by Plato, in a sense which the poet pever intended. Plautus
itudens· v. 1355 readers it, mem arbitratust lingua qued iuret mea.
