calls him a sophist. The Cyrenaics divided philosophy into five parts,
viz. the study of (ι) objects of desire and aversion, (α) feelings and
affections‚ (3) actions, (4) causes, (5) proofs.

' 1. In the first alone of these divisions is the Cyrenaic view connected
with the Socratic. Aristippus taking up the Socratic position that
happiness (ie. the enjoyment of a well-ordered mind) is the aim of all
rnen, pronounced leasure the chief good and pain the chief evil, the
τέλος of human iile to be momentary pleasure (μονόχρονος, neptum:
present happiness therefore 'was to be sought, and not εὐδαιμονία, which
is the sum of a number of happy states. In this point the Cyrenaics
were opposed to the Epicureans. All pleasures were considered equal: so
that a man should never covet more than he possesses and never let him·
self be overcome by sensual enjoyment. Even with these concessions the
Cyrenaic system destroys all moral purity. by proposing to a man as many

link between the Cyrenaic and Epicurean schools. He was opposed to
Epicurus iu two points: (r) he denied that pleasure was merely the absence
of pain, for if so death would be a pleasure ; and (ο) he attributed to every
separate act a distinct object, maintaining that there was no general end of '
human life. He differed from Aristippus, inasmuch as he allowed that
friendship‚ patriotism and similar virtues were good in themselves. Jtict.

Hence Cicero speaks of Epicurus as eiusdem fere auctor adiutorque seu·
tentiae (Diogen. Laert. 11 89). His sect became so completely out of date
(quibus obsoletis) after Epicurus’ time, that no mention is made of them by
any succeeding writers, such as Ammonius, Alexander Aphrodisiensis
lamblichus, Proclus or Simplicius, except Clemens Alexandrinus.
