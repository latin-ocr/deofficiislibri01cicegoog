decumae nomine] ‘on pretence of their being a tithe·0ffering.' It
was a Roman custom to offer a tenth of their property or gains upon any
great undertaking, or after any signal success (as Plutarch records of Sulla
c. 35 and Crassus c. a), to be expended on a costly sacrifice, generally to
Hercules. Hence Herculanea pars, ‘Hercules’ share,’ is used as an equi·
valent to ‘a tenth part' by Plaut. Trucul. 11 7, 11 *. The public came in
fora share of the remeius of the victims used for such sacrifices, and the
entertainments on such occasions were so magnificent, that polluctura

such an offering to Hercules‚' came to mean simply ‘good cheer,' and

Roman knight, a friend of Atticus and Cicero, quaestor along with Q.
Hortensius in the year of Sulla's second consulship. In a time of great
scarcity during his aedileship Β. c. 74 he is said to have supplied the people
with corn for a small sum, and the credit which he thus obtained served
to retrieve the disgrace (invidia) which he had previously fallen into by his
condemnation for some unknown offence alluded to pro Planc. 5 12 qui ne

considered a very low price ordinarily even in Sicily, where corn grew in
