xxxvi Introduction

the best society. Itis probable, however, that his detailed

explanation of decorum (1 §94-100) is founded on the ideas
'of Panaetius ; auyhow the definition and division of the ideas
was not devised by Cicero. In the same way Panaetius no
doubt had already allowed greater scope to the variety of
men's individuality than is consistent with the strict priuci-
ples of the Stoics‚ 13 107 ff.; Cicero even declares it to be
possible and admissible for one man to excel in one virtue,
34 another in another (1 5 115). If we examine his treatment
of the several branches of his subject, we shall find all of
them interwoven with examples taken from Roman History,
and references to the political position of Rome at the time,
s often indeed disadvantageously3 for the bitterness of feeling
which the writer betrays, aud the blindness aud prejudice with
which he judges his adversaries, become distasteful to the
reader⁹⁰. The tone and spirit in which he speaks of individual
duties is thoroughly Roman, and it is evident throughout-as
indeed might be expected from its dedication tobis son Marcus
-that the work was composed for the use of a young noble
Roman, who was about to devote himself to politics ,· indeed
Cicero professes this as the intention of his work, in the pas·
sage where he is writing of glory⁹¹, when he says that he shall
speak more fully of glory, because it is of great utility for one
who is about to devote himself to the service of the state
15 It may naturally be supposed that the society of Scipio
aud other Roman nobles must have exercised a considerable
influence on Panaetius, still we may be sure that a Greek
· philosopher could never have written a treatise ou duties like
this of Cicero. Thus in the first part conceming wisdom
(1 c. 6), which is altogether disproportionately short, nothing is
said of εὐβουλία, νουνέχεια, εὖλογιστία and all the other vittues
which the Stoics made subordinate to φρόνησις”, but he speaks
of the wrong desire of learning, i. e. the desire of learning
things without practical interest, and of the right desire, which
is allowable only so far as it does not interfere with a life
