kur Introduction

a as the desire after society and so the fulfilment of the
’ only conditions on which this society ean be maintained,

3 as the desire for pre-eminence,

4 as the desire to control the passions and preserve dig-
nity and selfrespect⁶⁰. Thus the Stoics arrive at the four
cardinal Virtues of Plato, which, according to their theory that
knowledge lies at the bottom of all virtue, they defined as
follows: Prudence as the knowledge of good and evil and inter-
mediate things, Discretion (σωφροσύνη) as the knowledge of
what ought to be chosen and what rejected, Justice, as the
knowledge of the value which is to be assigned to each thing,
Courage as the knowledge of what is to be feared and what
not. Still in these definitions individual members of the Porch'
were not all agreed⁰¹.

25 Of these four cardinal Virtues there are further subdivisions
which are given differently by different Stoics: they are to be
discussed in the first book.

Our modern division of duties into duty towards God,
duty towards our neighbour and towards ourselves, was nn·
known to the Stoica for with them each duty is a duty
towards the deity, and therefore every transgression an offence

between the individual virtues is not so strongly marked in this passage as
in Stobaeus ecl. eth. p. ιο8,Ι who first lays it down es the aim of all virtue

ἀκολούθως τῇ φύσει ζῆν and then adds that men have from Nature ἀφορμὰς
