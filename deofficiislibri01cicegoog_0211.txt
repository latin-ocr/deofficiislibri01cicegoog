CHAPTER I.

P. 8 5 1, t L annum tam audientem] Cicero sent his son to Athens
about the first of April ne. 45, as he tells us in a letter to Atticus written
the next year (xv 15), in which speaking of his son he writes smputad
firmum sali post Kal. April-sic enim annuum tempus confici-mid

datum esse. As Cicero espeaks in the text of his son annum aium audientem

Cratippum, it is inferr that he began this Treatise in the spring or early
in the summer of nc, 44, two or three months at most after the assassinu·
tion of Caesar. On the other hand, the following reasons may be given
for believing that the treatise was not commenced until the autumn of the
same year. (r) In the very frequent letters of this period, which give us a
full account almost of the daily occupations of Cicero, there is no mention
of a work deo 'is until Oct. galsspmd Art. xv 13). (a) Cicero implies
(Off. 111 ᾖ 121 that this bbo‘k was intended as a substitute for the instruc-
tion which he had designed giving his son in person at Athens. It may be
supposed therefore that it was written after the project of visiting Greece
was abandoned. Now we leam from Ep. ad Ate. xv1 7tlrat having set
out on a voyage, he was driven back to the vicinity of Rhegium on the oth
of August, and was induced to give up his visit to his son and return to
Rome by the representations of his friends that a favourable change in
public affairshud taken lace, and that his presence was demanded. He
reached the Capitol on tle last day of August, and having on September
the and delivered his first Philippic, retired soon after to his villa at
. Puteoli. Here he spent the months of October and November, and is sup-
posed to have employed himself in writing this work. It is agreed that it
was finished before the ninth of December. A. W. Zumpt suggests that
the disagreement may be reconciled by supposing that the young Cicero,
although he left home on the first of April, did not for some time actually
commence his attendance on the instructions of Cratippus, and further,
that Cicero does not intend to speak with exactness in using the words
