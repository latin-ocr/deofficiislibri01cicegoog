ι’. 12³, 1. 2. quicum-mices] ‘to play at odd and even with,' 5 90
1. 25. Sueton. div. Aug. 13 alios, patrem et filium, pro vita rogantes sortiri

plied to a simple garne of the Romans which is still common enough among
their descendants and called la merra, in ι French la mourre. The game is
this: of two persons one, at a given signal, quickly opens any number of his
fingens. At the same moment the other endeavours to match his opponent
by opening the same number. In the light, ol course, each could see, as soon
as it was done, whether the guess was right. In the dark, honesty would be
the only check to deception ε hence to play with a man in the dark implied
full confidence in him. See note by SlrJ. G. Wilkinson in Rawlinson's
