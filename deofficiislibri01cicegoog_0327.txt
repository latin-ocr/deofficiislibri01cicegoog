moral rectitudo, or rather from every one of its constituent virtues'

ducerentur] After a leading proposition in a past tense dependent in-
terrogative and objective propositions are expressed in the imperfect,
although their import may hold good also at the present or at all times (in
which case the present is often used in English), Madvig Gr. 5 383. lt is
the prevailing idiom of Cicero to construet the present tense with historic
consecutiou, Ρ. S. Gr. p. 483, cp. 15291. 13.

M. advitae cultum] 1512 l. 28.

ut. inquo tum quaeri unqua ursse] sc. esset, 1 5 1521. 5,59.
Τὴε tum is transposed from its proper place before quid utile. Facciolati
and others consider that this passage, the second clause of which is not
found in several os the best MSS, is spurious and a marginal gloss on libro
superiore. In quo must refer to the whole clause ut-persequar.

cal method l have choscn. ‘The prooemium, wherein Cicero justifies his
devotion to philosophy after the fall os the Republic (5 1--6) and his
philosophical method (5 7), agrees with that of the first Book de nat. deor.
In his writings subsequent to the years Β. c. 44 and 43 the prooemia are not
so carefully worked up as in the de legibus and de rep, but are contracted
into a narrow range of osten-recurring thoughts: ep. ad Att. XVI 6 5 4,
he says haheo volumen prooemiorum: ex eo eli'gere soleo, cum aliquod ahy-
ypauminshtui’ Heiue.
