PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITlON

THE present edition of the de ‹fficiir has been so much
ι altered and enlarged that it may fairly lay claim to
be'considered a new work rather than a second edition
of the volume published fifteen years ago. The latter
laboured under so many blemishes and imperfections‚

which time and, I trust, more matured scholarship have ’

enabled me to correct, that I could not rest satisfied
without subjecting it to a thorough revision, notwith-
standing the scanty leisure lest me by arduous pro-
sessional duties: under this process the commentary
on the text has grown to double its original bulk,
a large amount oi explanation and illustration having
been added to the notes, which have themselves been
abridged and otherwise modified, in many cases en-
tirely re·written.

I trust that the volume in its new form may ‘satisfy
the wants oi more than one class of readers—I may
now venture to add oi both sexes,
