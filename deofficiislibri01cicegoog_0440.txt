1. 29. formulae] ‘established forms' oi legql procedure, under some

one of which ever action at law must be broug as in our law under the
head (fiorarulol oiselony, larceny, arsen, misdemeanour, dec.

Upon the suppression oi certain sacramental forms called legis actiones
‘actions oi the law‘ by the lex Aebutia about ac. roo by reason oi the
excessivo nicety of their technicalities, the formulary system took their
place. The essential feature oi this system consisted in a formula, which
the praetor (in iure) prepared aiter hearing the parties to a suit, and which
was remitted to the iudex to regulate his decision (in iudicio). All the
formulae generally in use were to be found in the album Praetoris, and
they were nnrltiplied from time to time to suit tbe exigeucies oi particular
cases. 'l'he three parts of the formula were (ι) the demonstratio,
(statement of facts, and ground oi action), (a) intentio (plaintiffs claim,
and the question ior the decision ol the iudex, and which mightbe
modified with the words quantum aequius melius sit, or ea fide iona
binding the iralex to take the whole circumstances into equitable considera·
tion), (3) condemnatio, which* gave the iudex power to condemn or aequit
the defendant, and which was usually qualitied with a taxatio, restricung
the amount of damages to be awarded by the iudex to a certain maximum,
or adiud irati o, giving the iudex or arbiter power to adpludicate. We have
the text oi a formula given by Gaius (4, 47), 1n a case w ere Aulus Agerius
sued Numerius Negidius sor restoration oi a silver table deposited with him
and, iailing restitution, ior payment of damages :-

Octavius iudex esto; Quod Aulus Agerius apud Numerium
Negidinm mensam argenteam deposuit ; qua de re agitur ;

Quidquid oi eam rem Ν. Negidium A. Agerio dare sacen
oportet ex fide bona eius ;

iudex N. Nigidium A. rigerio condemnato, nisi restituat;
si non paret, absolvito.

When the parties had appeared iu court, the plalntifl' declared his form oi
action (editio actionis), and applied to the magistrate for a formula
(actionis postulatio). The magistrate or praetor appointed a iudex for the
trial of the case, and delivered to him a formula determining the question
to be decided. The delivery of the formula eum iudicium accim was
the moment of the litis contestatio, which ended the proceedings in iure.
Such formulae were those of Aquilius de dolo malo ior the guidunceol
the iudex ia a claim ior restitution, where a fraud had been practised inu
sale or some similar roceeding. The formulas system remainediu
force until the reign oiDiocletiam rc n. ²94· See rd Mackeuzie Studm
