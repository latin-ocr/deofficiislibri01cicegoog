Cic. ad fam. xv 16), though he was bom (rac. 342) in Samos, where he
spent the first eighteen years of his life. He afterwards went to Athens iu
tac. 3ο3 and thence to Colophon and Mitylene and Lampsacus, where he
taught philosophy for five years. In tac. 306 he went back to Athens aud
purchased the famous κῆποι Ἐπικούρου in which he established his philo-
sophical school. Our principal source of information respecting him is the
tenth book of Diogenes Laertius, besides the hilosophical poem of Lucre-
tius de rerum natura, Cicero de finibus and enatura deorum, who writes
ina hostile spirit about his philosophy and unjustly brands him as a man
devoted to sensual pleasures. Diogenes calls him πολυγραφώτατος and
gives a list of the best of his works together with some of his letters and
the κύριαι δόξαι, ie. peculiar propositions‚ containing the substance of his
ethical philosophy. His most important work was that περὶ φύσεως in 37
books, parts of which were discovered among the rolls at Herculaneum
and have been published. Epicurus prided himself upon being αὐτοδίδακ·
τος, but he was in reality indebted both to Democritus and the Cyrenaica
His ethical system arose from the peculiar circumstances of his time, when,
in the absence of political lreedom, thinking men endeavoured to establish
an internal freedom based upon ethical principles: they regarded perfect
independence, sels-reliance, and contentment as the summum bonum, fol·
lowing the dogma of the Cyrenaics that pleasure constitutes the highest
happiness and consequently must be the end of all human exertions. But
pleasure with him was conceived of not as a mere momentary and transi·
tory sensatim, butas something lasting, which consisted in pure and noble
mental enjoyments, and freedom from pain and disturbing influences (ἀταραξία
and dumiah-peace of mind based upon φρόνησις, which he described as
the beginning of everything good, as the origin of all virtues, and even as
the summum bonum itself. In the physical part of his philosophy he
adopted the atomic theory of Democritus-as we know from Lucretius
His ethical doctrines were'much mistaken in after ages, and made to mi·
nister to mere sensuality. At Rome, owing to the paramount influence ol
the Stoical philosophy, they never took firm root. See Dict. os Gr. arrd

l. 21. Metrodoro] Metrodorus (Μητρόδωρος) of Lampsacus was
the most distinguished of the disciples of Epicurus, who would have
appointed him his successor had he survived him. He died rac. 277 in his
53rd year. T he philosophy of Metrodorus was more sensual than that
of his master (Cic. de nat. deor. 1 5 113, Tusc. v 5 ογ,Ι de tin. 11 5 99.
