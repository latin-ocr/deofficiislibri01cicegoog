1.1n. eepumum annum] The usual interval between the Praetorsbip
and Consulship was three years, as in the case of Cicero himself.

1.14. meret] ‘remained in obscurity,' the usual phrase for those
aspirants to public offices who allowed more than the ordinary timeto

who had the agnomen of Numidicus from his victory over Jugurthaiu
Numidia. Cp. Ovid Fasti 1 593 Asm'ca victorem de se amat: alter Isau·
ras Ι ant Cretum dorreitas testificatur opes,· Ι laune Numidae faciunt,

Α frica nomen, Scipio quod victor quodque Metellus habet For the fact
here related see Sall. Iugurth. 64.

1. tr. ab eo-Romam missus esset] According to Sallust l. e Metel·
lus had given leave to Marius to return home athis own suit, and more·
over had provolred him by his sneers. So Plutarch. Mar. 8 ml δὴ rurale·
πὼν ἡμᾶς, ὦγενναῖε, πλεῖν ἐπ’ οἴκου διανοῇ καὶ παραγγέλλειν ὑπατείαν;αὐ
γὰρ ἀγαπήσεις, ἄν rui ἐμῷ παιδὶ τούτῳ aeromantiam 3 ἢν δὲ ὀπαῖς τότε
τοῦ Μετέλλαν παντάπασι μειράκιον.

L 18. ducere] i.e. producere, trahere, ‘that he was protracting.’ Illum
refers of course to Metellus, although the simple pronoun of reference eum
had been used in speaking of him before in the same sentence: the reason
is, that another subject intervenes viz. populum Romanum, hence the
necessity for a more distinct reference in mentioning Metellus.

1. 19. st-tectssent] For tense see 5 77 l. 29 n.

1. 20. redacturum] Sall. l. c. represents Marius as saying dimidia
pars exercitus si sibi permitteretur, paucis de'ebus Iugremlram in rotensi tabi·
turum, ab imperatore consulto malti, quod homo inauri et regim superam
imperio nimis gauderet.

1. 22. qut-adduxerit] causal subjunctive, to which esset in the next
clause is assimilated.

cutus legatus esset] This is repeated for the purpose of marking more
strongly the impiety of the act laesio mandati. It was considered asa
breach of piety foraformer legates to appear as a witness in a court of
justice against his imperator.

§80,1.24. ne noemi· quidem Gratidianus] i.e. ne noster (‘my reta·-
tive’) quidem Marius, nempe Gratidianus, ς 67. M. Marius Grati·
dianus, son of M. Gratidius, adopted son of a brother of the famous
Marius (de leg. 111 ἓ 36). He was praetor Β. c. 86 and for the second time
nc. 82. His edietum conceming the coinage (see below note to l. ry)
made him very popular, so that statues were raised in all the ublic places
to the author of so beneficent a reform, and almost divine honours were
paid to these statues by burning incense and wax tapers before them.
