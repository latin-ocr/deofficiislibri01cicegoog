⁷ classed the πρῶτα κατὰ φύσιν already mentioned, together with
wealth, honour, high birth, and their· contraries, ἀποπροηγμένα,
rer'm‘u, ‘undesirable things⁵⁷.’ Between these two lie the ἀδιοί-
φορο in the proper sense of the term, those things which excite
neither desire nor aversion, as the raising this or that finger,
the taking up a leaf from th'e ground or not

Although in opposition to the wise man all not wise men 23
are sools, yet the later Stoics modified the assertion, that all
unwise men are equally bad; by which they ran counter to the. ,
general sentiment They agreed that there was a state os
‘progression' (προκοπή) or improvement, and that some were
further removed srom their ideal than othersw. This was in
accordance with their idea os virtue, sor, like all the Socratic
¹schools‚ they defined Virtue as a Science. Wisdom (σοφία)
is that which lies at the foundation of every virtue⁶⁹. Virtue
therefore can be taught and acquired by gradual progress.
Thus the Stoics could write in a practical way about duties,
when they set aside their distinction between the Wise and
the Unwise.

For the development of the special virtues, the Stoics ap· 24 ,
pealed to primary natural impulses, and maintained that the
desire to live conformably to reason shews itself in a tourtold , ¹
manner:

between things προηγμένα and ἀποπροηγμένα was a compromlse between
the paradox that ‘nothrng is good but virtue‚’ and the practical facts of
lite. Stoicism is forced to be full of such compromises.” Sir A. Graut,
Oxsord Essays, 1858, p. 88.
, ⁶⁸ “This notion of consciens moral progress,'' observes Sir A. Grant,
Α l. c p. 93, “and seli-discipline is too familiar now for us easily to believe
that it was first introduced into Greece in the third century tae. It may
be said indeed to be contained implicitly in Aristotle's theory of ‘habits’;
but it is in reality the expression of a new and totally different spirit. By
this spirit we shall find the later Stoics deeply penetrated. It constituted
perhaps the most purely moral notion of antiquity‚ as implying the deep·
est associations which are attached to the word ‘moral’.''
