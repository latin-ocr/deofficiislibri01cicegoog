we could conceive anything similar
tcctive system in the intellectual de-
tt, we might perhaps look forward to
vhen our historians would raise the
protection for native industry. of
uestionrbly greatest German men of

history—l speak of Frederick the
{oethe and Stein-the first two found
ce in Carlyle and Lewes biographers
ve undoubtedly driven their German

tots out of the field. And now in the .

t past Professor Seeley of Cambridge
tented us with a biography of Stein
hough it modestly declines competi·
:h German works and disowns the
tion of reaching us Germans our own
yet casts into the shade by its bril-
periority all that we have ourselves
written about Stein... In five long
t Seeley expounds the legislative and
:ratrve reforms, the emanciparion of
son and the soil, the beginnings of
ninistration and free trade, in short
dation of modern Prussia, with more
,ve thoroughness‚ with more pene·
insight, than any one had done be-

Buseh's volume has made people
dtalk even more than usual of Priuce

Stein will turn attention to an earlier
lmost equally eminent German states·

. . . . Itis soothing to the national
ect to find a few Englishmen, such
te Mr Lewes and Professor Seeley,

doing for German as well as English readers
what n÷any German scholars have done for
us.''- chres.

'‘ ln a notice of this kind scant justice can
be done to a work like the one before us; no
short rosum! can give even the most meagre
notion of the contentsof these volumeS, which
contain no page that is superfluous, and
none that is uninteresting ..... To under-
stand the Germany of to·day one must study
the Germany of many yesterdays‚ and now
that study has been made easy by this work,
to which no one can hesitate to assign a ve
high place among those recent histories whic
have aimed at original rescarch.''-Atlu·
naeum.

“The book before us fills an important
gap in English-nay, European-historical
literature, and bridges over the history of
Prussia from the time of Fredericlr the Great
to the days of Kaiser Wilhelm. lt thus gives
the reader standing ground whence he may
regard contemporary events in Germany in
their proper historie light ..... We con·
glratulate Cambridge and her Professor of

istory on the appearance of such a note-
worthyproduction. And we may add that it
is something upon which we may congratulate
England that on the especial held of the Ger·
mans, history, on the history of their own
country, by the use of their own literar-y

weapons an Englishman has produced a his· ·

tory of Germany in the Napoleonic age far
superior to any that exists ln German.”-
