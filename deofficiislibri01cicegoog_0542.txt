a Map and English Notes by Anrnnn Pharon, Μ.Α., Fellow oi
{zglatlharilrgssfiollege Cambridge ; Editor of Persius and Cicero ad Aurium

‘⁸ In Mr Pretor's edition of the Anabasis the textos Kilhner has been followed in the mam,
while the exhaustive and admirable notes os the great German editor bave been largely unlised.
These notes deal with the minutest as well as the most important difficulties in construction, and
{ll questions of history, antiquity, and geography are briefly but very effectually crucinam-nt

xammcr.

“We welcome this addition to the other books os the anabasis so ably edited by Mr Pretnr.
Although originally intended sor the use of candidates at the university local examinations, yet
this edition will be found adapted not only to meet the wants ol' the junior student, but eren
advanced scholars will find much in this work that will repay its perusal.’'-Tlrc Schoolmrrer.

“Mr Pretor’s ‘Anabasis os Xenophon, Book lV.’ displays a union οἰ accurate Cambridge
scholarship‚ with experience os what is required by learners gained in examining middle-class
schools. The text is large and clearly printed, and the notes explain all difficulties. . . . hir
Pretor's notes seem to be all that could be wished as regards grammar, geography, andotber
matters.’'- The Academy.

“Another Greek text, designed it would seem ior students preparing sor the local examinatior-s
is ‘Xenophon's Anabasis,' Book 11.. with English Notes, by Alfred Pretor, ΜΛ. The editor bas
exercised his usual discrimination in utilising the text and notes os Kuhner, with the ocoesientl
assistance oi the best hints os Schneider, Vollbreeht and Macmichael on αἰκία] matters, andei
Mr R. W. Taylor on points os history and eography. . . When Mr Pretor commits himself to
Commentator's work, he is eminently helper. . . Had we to introduce a young Greek schoht
to Xenophon, we should esteem ourselves fortunate in having Pretor's text-book as our chart and
gemet-contemporary Revr'ew.
