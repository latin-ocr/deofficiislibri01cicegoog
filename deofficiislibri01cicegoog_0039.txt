part on the conflict between virtue and expediency.

30 The part which was wanting in Panaetius Cicero treated
independently, i. e. without having a model to follow, such as¹ ³
he had in the first books in Panaetius, in the division and the
discussion of his subject⁰¹2 we learn from his own statement⁸¹
that he consulted sor that purpose a work oi Posidonius,
the pupil os Panaetius; he seems however not to have borrowed
much from it, as Posidonius touched but slightly ou this part
of the doctrine of duties, and in general nothing that was written
on ethics since the time of Panaetius met with Cicero's appro
bation⁸²¹. He made use moreover oi an essay of Hekaton os
Rhodes out of which he takes the divergent views of Diogenes
and Antipater⁰⁴, and itis very likely that the ease stated in
111 ἓ 91, about which these two philosophers shew the same
difference of opinion, is also borrowed from it. ,

is supported by Cicero's own observation sequimur—potissimum
