“Professor Palmer’s activity in advancing
Arabio scholarship has formerly shown itself
in the productiori of his excellent Arabic
Grammar, and his Descriptive Catalogue of
Arabio MSS. in tbe Library of 'l'riniiy Col·
lege, Cambridge. He has now produced an
admirable text, which illustrates in a remark·
able manner the flexibility and graces of the
language he loves so well, and of which he
seems to be perfect master... The Syndicate
of Cambridge University must not pass with·
out the recognition of their liberality iri
bringing out, in a worthy form, so important
an Arabio text. lt is not the firsttime that
Oriental scholarship has thus been wisely
subsidised by Cambridge.”-Jndi'an Mail.

“ltisimpossible to quote this edition with-
out an expression of admiration for the per·
fection to which Arabio typography hasbeen
brought in England iri this magnificent Ori-
ental work, the productiori of which redoiinds
to the imperishable credit of the University
of Cambridge. lt may be pronounced one of
the most beautiful Oriental books that have
over been printed in Europe: and the learning
of the Editor worthily rivals the technical
get-up of the creations of the soul of one of
the most tasteful poets of islam, the study
of which will contribute not a little to save
honour of the poetry of the Arabs.’'-

“For ease and facility, for variety of

metre, for imitation, either designed or uo·
conscious‚ of the style of several of our own

ets, these versions deserve high praise.
iiie have no hesitation in saying thatin both
Prof. Palmer has made an addition to Oti·
ental literature for which scholars should be
grateful; and that, while his knowledge of
Arabic is a sufficient guarantee for his mas
tery of the original, his English compositions
are distinguished by versatility, command of
language, rhythmical mdence, and, as we
have remarked‚ by not unskilful imitations of
the stples of several of our own favoun'te
poets, iving and dead.''-Saturday Κινέου.

“This sumptuous edition of the poeins of ’
Behfied-din Zoheir is a ve welconie addi·
tion to the small series o Eastem poets
accessible to readers who are not Oriental-
ists. ln all there is that exquisite finish of
which Arabic poetry is susceptible iii so rare

adegree. The form is almost alwaps beau-

tiful, be the thought what it may. ut this,

of ¹course, can only be fiilly appreciated by
Orientalists. And this brings us to the trans·
lation. lt is excellently. well done. Mr
Palrner has tried to imitate the fall of the
tiltlt¹ihlts⁵zlttltlti‘ltilltlsslttlt
convey a faint idea of the graceful flow of
tlie Arabic. Altogether the inside of the
bpok is worthy of the beautiful arabesque
binding that rejoices the eye of the loverof
Arabum-academ.
