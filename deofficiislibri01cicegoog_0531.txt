THE ANALYTICAL THEORY OF HEAT,
By Jossrrr Founrnn. Translated‚with Notes, by A ansrrnn, M.A.,

Fellow of St John’s College Cambridge. Demy 8νο. 16s.

“ It is time that Fourier's masterpiece,
The Analytical Theory gf Heat, trans-
lated by Mr Alex. Freeman‚ should be in-
troduced to those English studems of Mathe-
rnatics who do not follow with freedom a
treatise in any language but their own. It
isa model of nrathematical reasoning applied
to physical phenomena‚ and is remarkable for
the ingenuity of the analytical process em·
ployed by the authors-contemporary
Review, October, 1878.

“There cannot be two opinions as to the

value and importance of the Thtorie de la
Chaleur. It has been called ‘an exquisite
mathematicalpoem,'notoncebutmanytimes,
independently, by mathematiciansof different
schools. Many of the very greatest of mo·
dem mathematicians regard it, justly‚ as the
key which first opened to them the treasure·
house of mathematical physics. Itis still tlu
text-book of Heat conduction, and there
seems little present prospect of its being

“This work, which derivesnmelancholy . . . Every de artment of editorial duty
interest from the lamented death of theeditor appears to have been most conscientiously
following so closely upon its publication, isa performed: and it must have been no small
valuable addition to the history of electrical satisfaction to Prof. Maxwell to see this
research. .. . The papers themselves are most
carefully reproduced, with fac-similes of the
author's sketches of experimental apparatus.
