t lt. praeceptio] ‘the giving of precepis'

L 16. mutem, Pyrrhonis, Erilli] Aristo of Chius (nc. 260) and
Erillus of Carthage were Stolos, Pyrrho of Elis was the founder of the
school of the Sceptics. They agreed in considering all external things
indifferent (ἀδιάφορα de fin.1v. 16, 53, Ac. 11 5 130), not to be reckoued
among things good or evil. 1. Pyrrho taught thisb denyingallgrounds
of truth. For, if in the case of our objects of thought there is never any
reason sor considering them, or any one of them, true rather than false,
then of course there is never any true ground for asserting that any extemal
object is good or a proper object of desire or preference. a. Aristo, like
Erillus, deviated fro'm Zeno, their common teacher and the founder of
their sect. He rejected all parts of philosophy except ethics, and even
limited the domain of ethics itself‚ for he taught that its object is not to
treat of particular duties and encouragements to virtue, but that it is the
province of the philosopher to shew wherein the supreme good conslsts.
With Aristo nothing is of worth but virtue, nothing is evil but vice. He
seeks to refute the opinion that there is such a difference in external things
that one is preferable to another (Ritter and Preller 358, Introd. §nat
3. Erillus, a pupil of Zeno, limits the sumntum bonum of the Saga to
science (ἐπιστήμη) and knowledge. He considers practical lise, which is
occupied about external things, as simply necessary and denies it to be
beautiful, on the ground that it does not contribute anything to the supreme
good. This principle, common to these three philosophers‚ strikes at the root
of practical morality: it takes away all dilectus rernm, ‘difference or power
of choosing between things, all materials for αἰτίαι to act upon‚' by which
means there is left no adnm ad inventionem efficii, ‘no way of finding out
what is our duty! For how can that Prudence‚ which is seen in wisely
choosing one thing before another, have any place, if all things are ecjgally
in themselves indifferent? And if there be no difference between sic ess
and health, riches and poverty‚ and it is as good for a man to be in one as
in the other of these, this takes away all obligations of assisting those that
are in sickness or want, seeing that, according to this opinion, they are not
any wise in a worse condition than the healthy or rich. And by conse·
quence‚ all Justice and Beneficence, etc. must fall to the ground. Comp.
