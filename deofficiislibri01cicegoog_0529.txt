THE BACCHAE OF EURIPIDES.

with Introduction, Critical Notes, and Archaeological Illustrations,
by J. E. SANDYS, M.A.‚ Fellow and Tutor oi St John’s College, Carn-
bridge, and Public Orator. Crown 8vo eloth. tos. od.

“ Of the present edition os the Baccloe by
Mr Sandys we may sasely say that never

before has a Greek play, in Englaud at

least, had fuller justice done to its criti· '

cisra, interpretation, and archaeologrcnl il·
lustratiom whether for the young student or
the more advanced scholar. The Cambridge
Public Orator may be said to have taken the
lead in issuing a complete edition of a Greek
play, which is destined perhaps to ain re·
doubled favour now that the study οῗ ancient
monuments has been applied to its illustra-
tion.''-Satura'ay Revt'ew.

“ Mr Sandys has done well by his poet and
by his University. He has given a most
weleome gift to scholars both at home and
abroad. The illustrations are aptly chosen
and delicately executed, and the ap aratus
pitteus, in the way both of notes autfindioes
tranunt. enascatur-..r
executed woodcuts, and rts general attractive-
ness os form reflects reat credit on the
University Press ln tle notes Mr Sandys
has more than sustained his well-earned
reputation as a caresul and learned editor,
and shows considerable advance in freedom
and lightness ot' style ..... Under such cir·
cumstanoes it is superfluous to say that sor
the purposes os teachers and advanced stu·
dents this handsome edition sar surpasses all
its predecessors. The volume will add to the
already wide popularity ot a unique drama,
aud must be reckoned among the most im·

portant classical publications oi the year.”-
Athenaeum.

“This edition oi a Greek play deserves
more than the passing notice acoorded to
ordinary school editions os the classics. It
has not, lite so many such books, been
hastily produced to meet the momentary
need of some particular examination3 but it
has employed ior some years the labour and
thought oi a highly finished scholar, whose
aim seems to have been that his book should
go forth totus teres at ue rotundus, armed
at all points with all that may throw light
upon its subject. The result is a work which
will not only assist the schoolboy or under·
graduate in his tasks, but will adorn the
library oi the scholar. ’' . . “The description
oi the woodcuts abounds in interesting and
{tutti titt?¹t.”¹;⁰ttt‘.¹‡¹¹?.tt¹t¹.‘:
of the very thorough as well as scholar·
like manner in which Mr Sandys dealt
with his subject at every point. 'The com· ·
mentary (pp. 87-240) bears the sarne stamp
os thoroughness and high finish as the rest oi
the work. While questions os technical
grammar receive due attention textual cri·
ticism, ¹philology, history, antiquities, and
art are in turn laid under contribution for the
elucidationes the poet's meaning. We must
leave our readers to use and appreciate sor
