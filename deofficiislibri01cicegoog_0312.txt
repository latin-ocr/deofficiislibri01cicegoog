1. 17. nascentem oet] now these two (ordo and opportunitas)
are comprehended under that science, which the Greeks call εὐταξία,
ιιοι in its sense of ‘sels-control' modestia, but in that of ‘correct
behaviour‚' propriety os our actions in regard to time and place.
Tacitus, hist. 11 5, employs the word dispositum to express the same
notior, and similarly Pliny epist 111 1 speaks οί dispositam vitam.

1. 19. hanc] by attraction sor hoc.

1. 21. ut eandam nos ‘modoetiam' appellemus] ‘to call it also ·
modestia) P. S. Gr. p. 468. Cicero means that there is no Latin word
which will exactly render the Greek εὐταξίαι modestia (Gr. μετριύτηι)
involves properly the notion os ‘moderatiori’ (modus Gr. μέτρον), he
takes a liberty therefore in using it in another sense, as equivalent to the
Greek εὐταξία. According to the Stoics it is the knowledge ol ranging
under their proper heads all that we have to say or to do ; thus the
meaning ot the words order (or regularity) and arrangement (or method)
appears to be identical: sor order also is defined by them ιο be the disposing
of things in their proper and suitable places. Now the place οί an action
is with thern its fitness as ιο time, and the fitting time toran action is
called in Greek εὐκαιρία, ἰιι Latin occasio, ‘season,' so that modestia here
(in the sense ol the word which is now given it) is to be understood as the
art os well-timing whatever we do. The Stoics defined εὐταξία (Sto
’ baeus 11 p. 106> as ἐπιστήμη πσῢ πότε πρακτέον καί πί μετά τι καί «loono
τῆς τάξεως τῶν πραγμάτων. The word is also applied to the harmony os
the individual soul, as when σωφροσύνη is defined to be εὐαρμοστία καί
εὐταξία ψυχῆς πρὸς τὰς κατὰ φύσιν ἡδονὰς καί λύπαι.

virtue which he defines as εὐταξία ψυχῆς. ἕξις καθ’ ἤν d ἔχων αιρετικίι
