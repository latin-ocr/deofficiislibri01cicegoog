ς 118. itam quod Herculem Prodicus dtur] for as to the story told of
Hercules by Prodicus, his case was different from ours: he was the son of
Jupiter, we are but ordinary mortals. On this use of nam see n. to 11 ὃ 47.
Some read Herculem Prodicium ‘the Hercules of Prodicus‚' ie. such as heis
represented by Prodicus. So Hercules Xenophontem epist. nd fam. v rr.
Terentianus Phormio pro Caecin. ἕ 27, Terentianus Chremes above 5 3ο,
senex Caecilianus pro Rosc. Amer. 5 46. For notices of Prodicus in
ancient writers see my Onomast. Aristoph. p. 915 sq. The substance of
his lecture as given by Xenophon in the well-known ‘Choloe of Hercules'
was this: “When Hercules, entering upon manhood‚ was on the point of
choosing between virtue and-vice, two women appeared to him, the one of
dignified heauty, purity, modesty, and discretiori, the other of n voluptuous
form and meretricious look and dress. The latter promised to lead him
by the shortest rond, without any toil, to the enjoyment of every pleasure.
The other, while she reminded him of his ancestors and his noble nature,
did not conceal from him that the gods, have granted nothing really
beautiful and good without trouble or pain. Hercules decided in favour
of virtue. The episode has been paraphrased in English verse by shen-
stone‚ and by Bishop Louth, and there is a prose translation of it iu the
‘Tatler' No. 97. Allusions to it are frequent in classical writers, e. g. Sil.
Ital. Punic. xv 18-127, Lucian Somn. c. 6, Deor. dialog. xx rr, Her·
motimus c. 25.

Heusinger supposes from the use of satus that the words are a quotation
from some older poet, who affected Greek modes of expression, σπείρειν
being often used in the sense of ‘to beget.' Comp. Cic. Timae. c. ιι moos.

opinions were formed in Cicero's time: cum vero accedit eodem quari
inanimus quidam magister populus atque omnib undeque ad vitia comeum
multitudo, tum plane iuta'nrur opinionum maritatae naturaque danem.
