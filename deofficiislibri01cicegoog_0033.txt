xxviii ’ Introduction

ffctb⁶⁴; Expediency‚ of course, cannot prescribe anything op·
posed to virtue, because virtue shews itself in the selection of
external things also, and whatever is opposed to virtue as the
highest principle and perfect happiness, cannot on that account
be expedient The difference between the two kinds of duties
is that the realization of virtue (κατορθώματα) is a duty under
all circumstances, whilst in reference to external things duty

may be varied by circumstances, the latter therefore are called
κατὰ περίστασιν καθήκοντα. Thus, for example, it is not always

a duty to restore what we have been entrusted with, or to
keep a promise⁶⁵. η ,

22 But while the Stoics proclaimed virtue alone and all its con-
comitants to be a good, and, in comparison with it, all other
things, not standing in immediate relation with man's happiness,
to be indifferent, still they were obliged to recognize a difference
between extemalthings. For they themselves taught that with
men as with other living beings the primary inclinations tend
towards certain external things which further and uphold life,
such as health, power, good abilities, etc. the socalled πρῶτα
κατὰ φύσιν. These things then must have a different value from
their opposites⁶⁶. Again Virtue ought to shew itselfpractically
in our relation to these outward things.. It is not sufficient
merely to undervalue them, but a selection must be made
between them. How is this possible, if all are equally worth-
less? These considerations induced the Stoics not indeed to
give up the rigorous distinction between things of only rela-
tive worth and the absolute Good or Virtue, but to draw a
distinction between the ἀδιάφορα themselves, which they divided
into προηγμένα, producta, ‘desirable things,’ among which they
