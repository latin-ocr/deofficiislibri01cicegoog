Introduction xxxix

Eloquence are essentially the same as those in 11 c. 14, those
conceming munificence degenerating into profusion are the
same in 1 ἕ 43 and 115 53, those about the choice to be
made in rendering benefits in 1 ἐξ 49, 59 and 11 ἓ 61, and
lastly those about the duty of a statesman to make the good of
the whole state his whole end and aim inr 5 85 and 11 ἓ 7²·
This is for the most part Cicero's own fault, but it is also in
some measure owing to the inappropriate division which the
Stoics made of duties. Thus as true expediency coincides with
virtue and makes the same thing a duty, Cicero cannot avoid
considering the same duties in the first place from the point
of view of virtue and then from that of expediency.

The Third Book, in which Cicero especially prides himself 39
on his greater seli-dependence, is undoubtedly the most de·
fective of all in treatment. We have in it the constant repe·
tition of · the one sentiment that moral good is always expe· ·
dient, the contrary never, in endless variations, without any
systematic treatment or analysis. Digressions are made on
subJ'ects only slightly connected with the rest, asin c. 8 § 37 ff.
that no one may do wrong evenis sure of avoiding detection,
which is followed by an attack upon the Epicureans. His
examples are either treated with a breadth that savours of the
,rhetorical school, as the case of Regulus c. 26-32‚ or else are
mere sophisms‚ such as that taken from Hekaton e 23. In cc. 3
and 4 the difference between the virtue of the Sage and that
of ordinary men is fully discussed, but with no other result
than that both are forbidden to prefer expediency to moral
rectitude and decorum. In treating the question whether it
be possible for boantum and utilr'tas to be opposed to one
another Cicero argues in a circle (ὅ 20). In proving the posi·
tion cadem ut utr'litas uniuscuiusque et uniuersorum sit cc 5

and 6 he shews rhetorical fulness without subtlety (ἕ 27), and
after stating the essential point he commences the particular

treatment of the question in the subsequent chapter. Cicero
omits to tell us until ᾖ 96 that he has been taking the four Car-
dinal Virtues in this Book as in the others for the basis of

¹his proof, and that he *has already dealt with seemlng pm.
