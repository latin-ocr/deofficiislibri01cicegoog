340 NOTES Boox 111 c1x55 38 39

1. 44. bonta virts] Cicero rarely uses the recipient dative for the
ablative of the agent with passive verbs; only, with the exceptionofa
few instances, with the participle perfect passive, Zumpt Gr. 5 419,
Roby Gr. 11 1146, Kenn. Gr. p. 3 o, Madvig Gr.5 454 a. In fact after such
verbs as quaeri, audiri etc. the (i
by whom as the person for whom something takes place; and perhaps
with the participle perfect passive the dative may be explained as the
dativus commodi .· thus pertractata mihi sunt=pertractata habeo.

5 ³0, 1. 26. philosoplis qudam] the Epicureans. Rectitude according
to Epicurus is not φύσει but θέσει (1 5 14). Diog. Laert. x ¹51 ήάθιεία
οὐ καθ’ ἑαυτὴν κακόν, ἀλλὰ ἐν τῷ κατὰ τὴν ὑποψίαν φόβῳ, el μή λήσει
ὑπὲρ τῶν τοιούτων ἐφεστηκότας κολαστάς. οὐκ ἔστι τὸν λάθρα τι ποιοῦντα,
ὦν συνέθεντο πρὸς ἀλλήλους els τὸ μή βλάπτειν μηδὲ βλάπτεσθαι, πιστεύειν
dre λήσει, κάν μυριάκις ἐπὶ τοῦ παρόντος λανθάνῃ. Lucretius v 1150 11,
‘softens and tones down what Epicurus himself in the above passage
expresses in all its naked harshness,' Munro who also quotes Seu.

tingere ut lateat, latendi fides non potest...tutascelera essepossuut,
securo non possunt: and what the Epicurean says in Cic. defin. 5 50

minime muli 1111 quidem 441] i. q. boni homines in the ironical sense
in which it occurs 11 52. Cp. Tusc. 11 5 44 venit Epicums, homo
minime reulus, uel potirer uir optimus, de orat. 111 5 64 sicutenim
(Epicurei) boni uiri et, quoniam sihi ita uidentur, beati, Tusc. 1 5 6 (of
Amafanius and Rabirius) ab optimis illis quidem uiris, sed non satis
eruditis. So frequently in the comic poets as Ter. v 4, 5 ehodum,
boue vir, quid ogis? Cicero frequently taunts E icurus and his school
with their lack of wit and learning (perhaps in re erence to the contempt
which they affected sor Dialectic and Logic), as Tusc. 1 5 48 ex quo
intellegi potest quom acuti nutura sint, quoniam hacc sine doctrina
credituri ficerunt, in Pis. 5 70 uon philosophia solum sed etiam ceteris
studies, quaesere Epicurei neglegere solent, perpolitus, de fin. 11

satis acutusfuit. On illi quidun see 1 5 59 n.

1. tt. commenticiam] ‘imaginary.‘

1. 44. quau vero 1114-14144441] ‘asthough forsooth, he maintained,
asserted! Observe that quasi is followed by a verb iu the present con·
junctive, although the supposition is inadmissible, because in the preceding
clause the verb is the present (dicerni), Madvig Gr. 5 349 obs. Quasi
vero is used to correct an erroneous supposition, Madvig 5 444 ols- ι,
Ρ. S. Gr. 5 448. Vero seems not to have an adversative, but an
assertive sense, adding force to the word with which it isjoined, just
as in answers to a question in combination with ita, minime.
