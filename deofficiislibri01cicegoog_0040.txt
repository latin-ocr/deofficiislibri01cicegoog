Introduction xxxv

Stoicos reon ut interpretes, sed-e sontibus eorum rorterio arbitrio·
que nostro, quantum quoque modo ae'rtebe'tur, teeurremuffl, as well ’
as by the opinions of the ancientS, who speak of the book in Ἴ
terms of the highest praise⁸⁰. It is true, the very parts which 32 ’
Cicero himself professes in several places to be additions of
his own⁸⁷ on the superiority of particular virtues and particular
kinds os expediencyare either merely indicated, not fully
discussed, as 11 c. 25, or they are supported by the argu-
ments of the Stoics, as the question about the preference ·
os a life of practical or theoretical activity considered in
rc. 4 3, which formed the principal point of conflict between the
Stoics and Peripatetics. His alterations of their scientific
system amount to few, except that in all cases he shews an
evident desire to modify and mitigate the Stoic rigour, and dis-
criminates between theory and practice in a manner eminently
characteristic of himself ⁸⁰. Itis of very little consequence that
he substitutes rnegnitredo onr'reet for the ἀνδρεία of thestoics,
and makes fortitudo subordinate to it, while the Stoics mostly
do the reverse( Moreover his calling ‘moral good' terrestrem,
while the Greeks call it καλόν, is characteristic enough of the
difference between the Greek and Roman point of view, but no
corresponding new idea is conveyed with the change of term.
We must* not however sorget, that while the Greeks defined
the notion of καλὸν objectively, Cicero dwells more upon the
consideration that the donatum has or merits the applause of
right-minded men3 this accounts for his attributing a higher
value to glory than the Stoics did⁰⁰. Similarly he assigns a33
signification to the ‘becoming' (decorum), which it does not
bear with the Stoics. For while they profess a disregard for ’
form and external demeanour in comparison withavirtuous dis-
position, Cicero will have it that virtue should have a pleasing

exterior and not be opposed to the manners and customs of ,
