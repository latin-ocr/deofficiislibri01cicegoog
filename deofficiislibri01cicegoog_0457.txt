Sulla visited him with cruel retribution ior this popularity. He was
a iorrnidable political adversary, and in the eyes of the aristocratia party he
had committed a veritable crime in assailing a right os the State to alter
the value of the coinage. As soon therefore as the dictator entered Rome,
all the statues of Gratidianus were overthrowu, and he himself proscribed
and cruelly murdered, Cic. de pet. cons. ἓ ro, Seneca de ira 111 18, Lucan

The lex Flaminia, passed ata great crisis of peril to the Republic, when
Hannibal was now at the gates oi the city, suddenly reduced the silver
stercorius, which became from that time the true standard of value, from
ql, to ,¹1of a pound. It was this law which established the salse principle oi
regarding gold and silver coinage merely as a conventional sign of value,
subject to the will of the sovereign or the state. By means of the theory os
the money-sagn the monied oligarchy oi Rome produced grave perturbatione
in the monetary system by ialsifying the coins. In each successive issue oi
denarii there was a larger and larger proportion os plated pieces (ie. of
money containing only a thiu coating of the true metal over copper or iron),
until nc. 91 Μ. Livius Drusus caused the Senate to pass a decision that
in future issues there should be one plated copper denarius to seven of
silver. A iew years later, in Cinna's time, the value of the coinage had
become so dubious that no one knew what he was worth (quid laboret).
In nc. 84 the tribunes oi the people and the praetors deliberated on the
measures to be taken in order to remedy this deplorable state oi things.
An edictos the praetors instituted officers ior the verification oi the coinage,
suppressed the ensorced circulation os the plated denarii, ordered that they
should be withdrawn from the public coffers and that denarii of a true
· standard should be given in exchange. See an excellent Article on Money
in Greece and Rome in the Contemporary Rcuiew, Feb. r879, by Franqois
