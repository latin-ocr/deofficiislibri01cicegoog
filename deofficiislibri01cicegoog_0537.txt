Second Edition,Revised. Crown 8vo. eloth os.

“The lectures will be found most in-
teresting, and deserve to be carefnlly studied,
1 not only by rsons directlyconcerned with
instruction, ut by parents who wish to be
able to exercise an intelligent judgment in
the choice of schools and teachers for their
children. For ourselves, we could almost
wish 10 be 01 school age again, to leam
history and geography from some one who
could teach thern after the pattern set by
Mr Fitch to his audiente ...... But perhaps
Mr Fitch’s observations on the general con·
ditions of school-work are even more im·
portant than what he says on this or that
branch of study.”-Saturday Review.

“It comprises fifteen lectures, dealing
with such subjects as organisation, discipline,
¹erramining,language,factknowledge,science,
and methods of instruction; and though the
lectores make 00 0101001100 10 systematic or
exhaustive treatment, they yet leave very
little of the ground uncovered; and they
combine in an admirable way the exposition
01 sound principles with practical suggestions
and illustrations which are evidently derived
from wide and varied experience, both in
reaching and in examining. While Mr F itch
addresses himself specially to secondary
'school-masters, he does not by any means
disregard 01 ignore the needs of the primary
school.”-Scotsman.

“ 11 would be difficult to find a lecturer
better qualified to discourse upon the prac-
tical aspects of the teacher's work than Mr
Fitch. He has had very wide and varied
experience as 3 teacher, a training college
officer, an Inspector 01 schools, and as
Assistant Commissioner to the late En·
dowed Schools Commission. While it is
difficult for anyone to make many original
remarks on this subiect Mr Fitch is able 10
500311 with authority upon various contro·
verted points, and to give us the results of
many years' study, corrected by the obser·
vation of the various schemes and methods
pursued in schools of all grades aud cha·
racters.”-Tl1e Schoolmaster.

“All who are interested in the manage·
01011101 50110015, and all who have made the
profession 013 10301101 1110 work of their lives,
will do well to study with care these results
01 3 large experience and of wide observa-
tion. It is not, we are told, a manual 01
method; rather, we should say, it is that
and much more. As a manual 01 method
it isfar superior to anything we have seen.
Its suggestions 01 practical means and me-
thods are very 1310301ος 11111 11 has an ele-
ment which a mere text-book 01 rules 101
imparting knowledge does not contain. 115
tone is lofty; its spirit religious; its ideal 01

1110 teacher's aim and life pure and good . . .
The volume is one of great practical value.
lt should be in the hands of every teacher,
and 01 every one preparing 101 1110 office 01 3
teacher. There are many besides these who
will find much in it to interest and instruct
them, more especially parents who have chil-
dren whom they can 3110101 10 keep at school
till their eighteenth or nineteenth year.''-
The Nenconsormist and Independent.

“As principal 01 3 training college and as
a Government inspector 01 50110015, Μ1 F itch
has got at his fingers' ends the working 01
primary 0110031100, while as assistant com-
mrssioner to the late Endowed SchoolsCotn·
01155100 he has seen something 01 11101113-
chinery 010111 higher schools. . . . lllr
Fitch’s book covers so wide a field and
touches on so many burning questions that
we must be content to recommend it as the
best existing vade mecum 101 1110 teacher.
. . . He is always sensible, alwaysjudicious,
never wanting in tact. . . . 1111 F itch·isa
scholam he pretends to no knowledge that
he does not possess; he brings to 1115 work
the ripe experience 01 a well-stored mind,
and he 1105505505Ι 10 a remarkable degree the
31101 ex osition.''-PallMall Gazette.

“In his acquaintance with all descrip-
tions of schools, their successes and their
shortcomings, MrFitch has great advantages
both in knowledge andexperience; and if his
work receives the attention it deserves, it
will tend materially to improve and equalize
the methods 01 reaching in our schools, to
whatever class they may belong.''- St
James’s Gazette.

“lnnootherworkintheEnglishlanguage‚
so far as we know, are the principles and
methods which most conduce to successful
teaching laid down and illustrated with such
Erecision and fulness of detail as they are

ere.'¹-Leeds Mercury.

“The book is replete with practical
sagacity‚ and contains on almost all points
01 10101051 10 the teaching profession sug·
gestive remarks resting evidently on a wioe

There are few teachers who will not find
aids to reflection in the careful analysis of
the qualities required for success in reaching,

instruction and discipline, and 10 1110 03105-

problems with which the teaching profession
has to deal.''-Galzgnani's Messauger.
