t 26. t.. Pisone] Lucius Calpurnius L. F. L. N. Piso Frugi,
the annalist (Brut. 5 106, de leg. 1 5 6, ep. ad lam. 11111, a), was the
author os the law which established a permanent commission (quaestio
perpetuo) for the trial of provincial Governors who had been guilty ol such
illegal acts as came under the denomination repetundoe. The law was
carried by him when tribunus plebis, Β. c. 149 (Brut. l. 1.). Pighius (ann.
Rom. 11 p. 447) gives the following as the supposed text of the law: uti
quibus iu provinciis magistratus populi Romani eorumve comites contra leges
pecunias cepissent quiilve eouemisissent, earum iniuriarum ergo Romae quiri·
tori iudicioque quaesito suo repetere provinciales possent. The experiment
was found to work so well that from time to time new laws were passed,
by which new courts of a similar description were instituted for the investi-
gation of different offences, as the lex lunia passed by M. Junius Brutus,
a tribune of the plebs, the lex Servilio (uc. 105), the lex Acilia passed by
M. Acilius Glabrio, tribune os the plebs (1.1. 101, Verr. Act. 11 i. 9), the
lex Corrulia passed by Sullane. 81, and lastly the lex Iulia, passed by
C. Julius Caesar in his first consulship Β, c. 53. See Dict. os Autr'q. Art.
